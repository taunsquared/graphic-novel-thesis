# The Story

## Dream 1: Nostalgia

### Page 1

**"A long time ago..."**

**"before the Orbiters lived in the sky,"**

**"before we hid underground to survive The Burning,"**

**"we all lived together, on the Earth's surface."**

**"We could all breathe the air,"**

**"drink the water,"**

**"feel the sun."**

**"We were all..."**

**"FREE."**

## Chapter 1: Calm Before the Storm

Character designs: Majhee Suh, Iúna Morei, Kai Oliveira, Beatriz Cavalcanti, Nova Jatobá, Vec Barbosa

### Page 1

**"2066: São Paulo, Brazil"**

**"It was a day of hope and wonder."** 

**"The Space Consortium had just announced the completion of their third space farm, Mae Jemison Memorial Arboretum. The news feeds were drowning in photos of the ribbon-cutting event up in orbit, of beautiful, important people draped in gorgeously fashionable and unspeakably expensive formal attire, eSyrup fabric programmed to fluidly change colours in response to the lights, the music, their wearers' moods..."**

**"...of delicate, mouth-watering hors d'oeuvres made from the succulent crops grown and cultivated at the two older space farms, with their carefully filtered water and pristine soil..."**

**"...of the fleet of orbiting home pods that synchronised their velocities with the new arboretum in order to snag front row seats to this historic moment, when humanity proved its ingenuity once more..."**

**"...for the world was becoming too dirty, too extreme in its weather, to support industrial planetside farming..."**

**"...and many people, on this historic day of hope and wonder, were starving..."**

### Page 2

We see Majhee walking briskly through the crowded streets of São Paulo. Everyone is wearing what looks like light-weight full-body hazmat suits, flickering a bit as the eSyrup in the material absorbs dangerous radiation in the air. All hoods are up, breathing masks and googles are on. The air is hazy with smog, the sky a smeared grey-blue, and the mid-morning sun pale. As Majhee passes shops and cafes, the daily news appears in hologram-like projections that occupy the ceilings or hover at standing-head-height. Other humans have tiny projections coming from subdermally implanted chips in their wrists, palms, ears, or foreheads; these projections surround their wrists, palms, ears, or face with a sphere of light, either sonifying or visualising entertainment, memories, mental models, dreams, news, scholarly publications. 

A lot of the news is about the new space arboretum, but a few mention the new research base recently established on Mars. Most of the individual **INFO-SPHERE**s are focused on news about planetside climate disasters: 
* The Colorado River has dried up completely and the severe drought is causing mass migrations to the east, causing massive overcrowding in major inland ("mid-western US") cities.
* Last year's total evaporation of the River Niger has led to massive lootings at yet another hydropower station.
* An extremely aggressive water-borne disease has wiped out several major urban areas in China and India 
* In the past 10 years, illnesses from sun radiation, such as skin cancer, have had a thousand-fold jump in rate of diagnosis around the world.

*(cite the above news stories)*

### Page 3

We see Majhee walk past a large research facility, metal and glass architecture dully gleaming in the smoggy light, labeled "Laboratório Nacional de Biociências e Saúde Pública". 

*translation: National Laboratory for Biosciences and Public Health*

The front of the research facility is teeming with protesters, who hold signs and wave flags with slogans like "Não sirva aos tiranos em órbita!", "Educar crianças humanas, não máquinas corporativas!", and "Alimentar humanos não foguetes!" 

*translation: "Do not serve tyrants in orbit!", "Educate human children, not coporate machines!", "Feed humans not rockets!"*

Majhee sneaks into an alleyway to enter the research facility via a back door. We see a receptionist sitting behind a sealed glass window. Next to him is a decontamination chamber that all must pass thru in order to enter the research facility. 

Receptionist: **"Dr. Suh! Quão ruim é isso lá fora?"**

*translation: "Dr. Suh! How bad is it out there?"**

Majhee takes off her hood and googles - she is pretty and youthful for her 37 years, if it weren't for the many lines of worry and grim determination on her face. She shakes out her hair, cropped short in a bowl pixie cut. Clearly having many troubling thoughts, she begins taking off her eSyrup hazmat suit.  

Majhee: **"Ainda lotado."**

*translation: "Still crowded."*

Receptionist: **"Idiotas. Eles não entendem que estamos tentando ajudar?"**

*translation: "Idiots. Don't they understand we're trying to help?"*

Majhee: **"Bem, eles estão com fome. Não consigo pensar quando você está com fome."**

*translation: "Well, they're hungry. Can't think when you're hungry."*

Majhee removes her boots and steps into the decontamination chamber.

### Page 4

Majhee stands in her office, seemingly floating in the center of a giant transparent bacteria made of light. The light model of the bacteria is exquisitely detailed, and a section of the nucleoid is blown up for closer inspection. Majhee's fingers are raised in a well-practiced yet complicated gesture. Her face is darkened with barely contained rage. 

Off panel: **"Majhee, você não pode *colher* o *Space Consortium*..."**

*translation: "Majhee, you can't *scoop* the *Space Consortium*..."*

Majhee: **"Pela última vez, Márcia, não é escavar se estou fazendo tudo livremente acessível!"**

*translation: "For the last time, Marcia, it's not scooping if I'm making everything freely accessible!"*

We see Marcia Netto, President of the Laboratório Nacional de Biociências e Saúde Pública, in Majhee's doorway, rubbing her forehead with exasperation.

Marcia: **"Você sabe o que eu quero dizer. Eles estão *determinados* a ganhar dinheiro com os aplicativos da eSyrup, e quando você publica os desenvolvimentos do seu laboratório online sob uma licença Creative Commons, você torna essa aplicação da eSyrup tech *não patenteável*!"**

*translation: "You know what I mean. They are **determined** to make money off eSyrup applications, and when you post your lab's developments online under a Creative Commons license, you make that application of eSyrup tech **unpatentable**!"*

Majhee: **"Exactamente."**

*translation: "Exactly."*

Marcia: **"Mas você viu o que eles fizeram depois da nossa colaboração para combustível eSyrup! Este instituto não pode permitir outra rodada de ações legais como essa!"**

*translation: "But you saw what they did with after our eSyrup fuel collaboration! This institute cannot afford another round of legal action like that!"*

Majhee angrily turns off the giant bacteria of light with an impatient gesture as she turns to Marcia, furious.

Majhee: **"*Você* empurrou essa colaboração, contra minhas inúmeras objeções!"**

*translation: "**You** pushed that collaboration through, against my numerous objections!"* 

Marcia, immediately apologetic, hands up to ward off Majhee's anger

Marcia: **"Eu sei, eu *sei*, isso foi definitivamente meu erro, e eu sinto *muito*."**

*translation: "I know, I **know**, that was definitely my mistake, and I'm **sorry**."*

Majhee interrupts: **"E pare de falar como você *realmente* acredita em pesquisas de saúde proprietárias! Como é possível que *alguém* ainda possa ter essas visões *arcaicas*?"**

*translation: "And stop talking like you **actually** believe in propriatary health research! How is it possible that **anyone** can still hold such **archaic** views?"*

Marcia, defeated: **"*Sigh*. Só...tenha cuidado..."**

*translation: "**Sigh**. Just...be careful..."*

Marcia glances over her shoulder, then leans in to Majhee.

Marcia, low and careful: **"...há rumores que Space Consortium estão tentando *armar* eSyrup!"**

*translation: "...there are rumors that Space Consortium is trying to **weaponize** eSyrup!"*

Majhee, incredulous: **"Eles não ousariam--"**

*translation: "They wouldn't dare--"*

Felix, a scientist in Majhee's lab, appears at the doorway, breathless and distraught.

Felix: **"Majhee, meu pai-- Presidente Netto!"**

*translation: "Majhee, my father-- President Netto!"*

Majhee: **"Sinto muito, Marcia, vamos ter que continuar isso outra hora."**

*translation: "I'm sorry Marcia, we'll have to continue this another time."*

### Page 5

Majhee, Felix, and other members of Majhee's research group sit or stand in a cluster at one end of their lab benches in an upper floor of the research institute. The wall nearest to them is a floor-to-ceiling window, showing the dusty sky-line of São Paulo. The sun sits in a reddish hazy sky, just past the midday zenith. 

Majhee: **"Entou. Seu pai foi diagnosticada otra vez."**

*translation: "So. Your father has been diagnosed again."*

The circle of researchers: **Felix Grael**, a pale but handsome man in his late 20s, raised in Rio de Janeiro by Swedish immigrants who have since returned to Europe, his face lined with fear and sadness, head in hands as his elbows rest on his knees; **Kai Oliveira**, a much older woman of Japanese-Portuguese descent, grey-haired and hook-nosed, stern-faced and sitting stiffly in her chair; **Beatriz Cavalcanti**, a tall woman in her 30s, a Brazilian of Italian descent, mouth set in a grim line even as her hands squeeze Felix's shoulders in a motherly, comforting gesture; **Breno Leite**, a dark, thin man in his early 30s, born and raised in the streets of São Paulo by his young Brazilian single mother, who worked every day of her life before falling ill in order to send her son to university; **Nova Jatobá**, a young graduate student in her mid-20s, descended from indiginous Brazilians from deeper inland, her plump face lined with exhaustion; **Iara Gracie**, another young grad student in her mid-20s, who was born into an [old Brazilian martial arts family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gracie_family) but chose the life of a scientist instead; **Vec Barbosa**, a portly Brazilian man of West African descent in his 40s, hands resignedly folded over a substantial beer belly, face troubled and sad behind a rather bushy yet neatly-trimmed beard.

Vec, to Felix: **"Já contactamos equipe médica de seu pai em Suécia, e demos-lhes acesso ao nosso banco de dados sobre pacientes com câncer de cutânea repetido. Isso melhorará consideravelmente dele chances de recuperação, mas..."**

*translation: "We've already contacted your father's medical team in Sweden, and we've given them access to our database."*

Beatriz, kindly: **"Mas tamben lembramos que seu pai teve um transplante de fígado. Se queres ir casa para estar com sua família, todo mundo vai entender."**

*translation: "But we also remember that your father had a liver transplant last year. If you want to go home to be with your family, everyone will understand."*

Felix: **"Não há nada que eu possa fazer lá de qualquer maneira..."**

*translation: "There's nothing I can do there anyway..."*

Felix now looks up, straight at Majhee, eyes furious, red, and glistening with held-back tears.

Felix: **"Precisamos terminar projecto biofilme, *antes* Space Consortium patenteiam qualquer outra coisa!"**

*translation: "We need to finish the biofilm project, **before** Space Consortium patents anything else!"*

Felix covers his face with his hands, furious at the tears that have started to stream down his face.

Beatriz: **"Tenho a *certeza* podemos gerenciar--"**

*translation: "I'm **sure** we can manage--"*

Kai, arms folded, looking down at her lap with hard eyes.

Kai: **"Não podemos terminar este projecto a tempo sem o Felix. Nós todos sabemos emenda é mais arte do que o algoritmo, e desde que minhas mãos começando a doer muito, Felix é o nosso *melhor*."**

*translation: "We can't finish this project in time without Felix. We all know splicing's more art than algorithm, and ever since my hands starting hurting too much, Felix is our **best**."*

Kai's brow furrows with frustration. 

Kai: **"Embora... nosso melhor pode não ser suficiente... Space Consortium anunciou sua eSyrup-emendado [halobacterium](cen.acs.org/energy/solar-power/Organic-solar-cell-smashes-performance/96/web/2018/08) há alguns dias atras, patenteando assim todas as células solares de eSyrup. Além disso, esta manhã eu tenho *isso*."**

*translation: "Although...our best may not be enough...Space Consortium announced their eSyrup-spliced [halobacterium](cen.acs.org/energy/solar-power/Organic-solar-cell-smashes-performance/96/web/2018/08) a few days ago, thus patenting all eSyrup solar cells. Also, this morning I got **this**."*

Kai passes up a small card to Majhee. Majhee reads from it.

Majhee: **"Você foi esbofeteado nos pulsos. Não nos faças ir para a tua garganta."**

*translation: "You've been slapped on the wrists. Don't make us go for your throat."*

Nova, looking terrified: **"O que isso quer dizer?"**

*translation: "What's that supposed to mean??"*

Kai: **"Space Consortium estão nos dizendo para parar de competir com eles. Processar-nos por patentes exclusivas no eSyrup foi o tapa nos pulsos."**

*translation: "Space Consortium's telling us to stop competing with them. Suing us for exclusive patents on eSyrup fuel was the slap on the wrists."*

### Page 6

Everyone takes a moment to imagine what it might be like if Space Consortium went for their throats. 

Iara: **"Meu avô ligou esta manhã...ele foi oferecido 10 billian reais na semana passada para me convencer a relatar o nosso trabalho não publicado."**

*translation: "My grandfather called this morning...he was offered 10 billian reais last week to convince me to report our unpublished work."*

Felix: **"Que??"**

*translation: "What??"*

Iara: **"Aparentemente esse não foi a primeira vez...ele tem uma oferta semelhante no ano passado, mas ele pensou que não valeu a pena mencionar."**

*translation: "Apparently that wasn't the first time...he got a similar offer last year, but he thought it wasn't worth mentioning."*

Nova, aghast: **"10.000.000.000 reais... isso é mais do que a *investidura do Instituto*..."**

*translation: "10 billion reais...that's more than the **institute's endowment**..."*

Breno: **"Vale a pena. Uma emenda estável com uma colônia bacteriana é o primeiro passo para as emendas vivas de eSyrup...qualquer um que faz isso poderia ganhar um monopólio de todas as aplicações clínicas e médicas da eSyrup."**

*translation: "It's worth it. A stable splice with a bacterial colony is the first step towards living eSyrup splices...anyone that does that could have a monopoly on all clinical and medical applications of eSyrup."*

We see Breno's moody, cynical eyes. 

Breno: **"Mas tenho certeza que 10.000.000.000 não é nada para um bebê de fundo de confiança como você, Iara..."**

*translation: "But I'm sure 10 billion is nothing to a trust-fund baby like you, Iara..."*

Felix: **"Vamos, Breno! Você sabe que *nenhum* de nós venderia para Space Consortium."**

*translation: "Come on Breno! You know *none* of us would sell-out to Space Consortium!"**

Breno, smiles ruefully, eyes pitying: **"Oh sim? Esse dinheiro daria a minha mãe a mesma qualidade de tratamento que seu pai recebe de graça na Suécia. O que te faz pensar que eu não desisti de uma tentação como essa?"**

*translation: "Oh yeah? That money would give my mother the same quality of treatment that your father gets for free in Sweden. What makes you think I wouldn't give in to a temptation like that?"*

Felix: **"Então coisa boa Majhee está pagando subornos dos médicos para sua mãe, no?! Se Iara é privilegiada, então você também é!"**

*translation: "So good thing Majhee is paying the doctors' bribes for your mother, no?! If Iara is privileged, then so are you!"*

We see the circle of researchers sitting in silence, betraying varying degrees of discomfort and fear.

### Page 7 

Majhee: **"Todos nós sabemos os riscos que vêm com o trabalho neste projeto, com o trabalho nesta cidade agora. Todos temos família para proteger."**

*translation: "We all know the risks that come with working on this project, with working in this city right now. We all have family to protect."*

Majhee: **"Eu também sei que se nós não começ estes protocolos de eSyrup no domínio público, muitos sofrerão porque não podem pagar o preço do Space Consortium.

*translation: "I also know that if we don't get these eSyrup protocols into the public domain, many will suffer because they can't pay Space Consortium's price."*

Majhee: **"Se você acha que deve sair, eu farei o que puder para ajudar você e sua família a saírem desta cidade, e fora do radar do Space Consortium."**

*translation: "If you feel you must leave, I will do what I can to help you and your family get out of this city, and off Space Consortium's radar."*

Majhee: **"Se você ficar...eu juro proteger você e suas famílias de qualquer maneira que eu puder."**

*translation: "If you stay...I swear to protect you and your families in any way that I can."*

**"6 months later: Massachusetts, USA"**

We see rolling countryside, vibrant with autumn colors, behind a low row of concrete warehouses, labeled "Morei Textiles". 

Off-panel, secretary: **"Iúna, the folks from the World Health Organization are here."**

Off-panel, Iúna: **"Thanks, I'll be with them in a minute."**

We see the inside of a warehouse, where long rows of industrial looms weave eSyrup textiles. Their combined activity generates a gently deafening **"WHIRRRRR"**. Iúna Morei, a tall shapely American woman of Portuguese descent in her early 30s, lustrous wavy brown hair pulled up into a bun, an infant with thick black hair strapped to her front, walks briskly and confidently away from a door labeled "Quiet Room" towards a group of humans waiting near the main entrance of the warehouse. 

Iúna smiles and yells as she waves towards her office door, just next to the entrance to the warehouse and labeled "Iúna Morei, CEO of Morei Textiles".

Iúna: **"HELLO! SHALL WE STEP INTO MY OFFICE?"**

### Page 8

Iúna: **"Thank you for bringing the new splicing and voltage-treatment protocols from São Paulo."**

Dr. Kauffmann: **"You know, you'd get these updates a lot faster if you'd just get an **INFO-SPHERE** mod..."**

Iúna: **"Dr. Kauffmann, I'm sure your colleagues can tell you how adamantly opposed I am to body modifications and eSyrup implants. I'm extremely grateful that you've taken the time to travel all the way from DC today."**

Dr. Kauffmann: **"Well, we were in Boston for an emergency conference, so it wasn't too much trouble. Besides, no one can beat your [MERV ratings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_efficiency_reporting_value). I've got your organzas in every window of my house."**

Iúna: **"Just doing what we can. What's the emergency conference about?"**

Dr. Kauffmann: **"They're preparing themselves for a huge wave of refugees."**

Iúna: **"Really? From where?"**

Under this dialogue is a view of Iúna's desk. We see sneak peek's of the new splicing and voltage-treatment protocols visualized with light, a floating sphere controlled by a thick piece of eSyrup canvas, stretched on a semi-circular frame that, when Iúna stands inside of it, places the canvas at about hip height, easy to reach while standing. Either one large image or many very close-up views. 

### Page 9

Dr. Kauffmann: **"Didn't you hear? A police raid in L.A. this morning started a huge fire that's spread halfway up the coast of California. It's so big it's getting blown over the mountains into Arizona by high winds. Everything out there is bone dry ever since the Colorado River disappeared."**

Iúna: **"What?? How many dead??"**

Dr. Kauffmann: **"Unfortunately we haven't had a chance to count yet. Thousands are already homeless."**

Iúna: **"How does a *police raid* start a *state-wide fire*??"**

Dr. Kauffmann: **"It's all that plastic furniture - they're basically *solid* petroleum, turns a misplaced candle into a fireball in *minutes*. And LA to San Francisco is so packed with cheap cookie-cutter homes, in retrospect, I'm amazed this didn't happen sooner...I'm sorry, I should have realised you wouldn't have heard yet...do you know anyone over there?"**

Iúna: **"Yes, I...I'm sorry I need to make a call..."**

Dr. Kauffmann: **"Of course. We'll see ourselves out."**

Under this dialogue we see close-up views of the baby strapped to Iúna's front. The child is a little less than one year old. The strapping is an intricately folded piece of eSyrup cloth that can amplify the baby's heartrate, breathing, and digestive sounds. 

### Page 10

Iúna: **"*Tahoe, have you been able to contact Joshua Tree?*"**

Iúna is outside, and her baby is no longer strapped to her chest. Instead, her face is covered in a thick veil and she wears what looks like a heavy, full-sleeved and full-length apron. eSyrup circuits flash within the weave of both Iúna's veil and apron. She stands, facing west, arms flung out wide, back straight and tall, legs apart, boots planted wide in the frosty grass. 

Iúna's Biononymous contact at Green Haven Tahoe: **"*Negative, Mama Bird.*"**

Iúna: **"*How is Tahoe?*"**

Tahoe: **"*Fire hasn't gotten further than Fresno, but we're getting ready to offer sanctuary.*"**

Iúna: **"*So...it *was* the body mod.*"**

Tahoe: **"*Looks like it. They didn't even bother going for the decoy.*"**

### Page 11

Iúna ponders for a moment, her face furrowed with grief and concentration.

Iúna: **"*Tahoe, I've changed my mind. I vote for registering as a religion.*"**

Tahoe: **"*Wa-wait, seriously?*"**

Iúna: **"*Yes. We need all of the protections we can get right now.*"**

Tahoe: **"*You been thinking about what Pigsah said?*"**

Iúna: **"*I hate to admit it, but they're right - it's relatively easy right *now* to live without body mods. But once all the schools require every student to get an **INFO-SPHERE** mod, once every industry requires employees to use body mods in order to be qualified for the job...our children **won't** have a choice. They'll have to list their body mods on their CV, you just won't be a qualified human *adult* if you don't have a body mod.*"**

Tahoe: **"*But...declaring ourselves a religion...it just feels like we're setting ourselves up for all the pitfalls of a *cult*.*"**

Iúna: **"*I know, that's why I intially voted against it. But we can't just empower individual decisions -- we have to figure how to co-exist with the rest of society. If we don't take drastic measures, in just 10 years it will be *impossible* to live without constant surveillance.*"**

### Page 12

Tahoe: **"*But there's so much we still haven't figured out...long-distance communication, ways to aid our memories and gain perspective on our behaviour...*"**

Iúna: **"*That's why I've changed my mind. Our eSyrup research needs to expand, and it needs to stay under the radar. Tahoe, do you know what that research group in Brazil published last month?*"**

Tahoe: **"*What?*"**

Iúna: **"*The first successful splice of eSyrup with a living organic compound, a recipe for creating eSyrup *biofilm*!*"**

Tahoe: **"*...Sorry Mama Bird, I don't follow eSyrup research like you do. Why should I care about biofilm?*"**

Iúna: **"*Because that's the *beginning*. Those bastards managed it before Space Consortium, got it published before Space Consortium could patent it. Remember how we once talked about synthetic companion creatures, that can act like portable, non-invasive **INFO-SPHERES**?*"**

Tahoe: **"*Yeah, but didn't we decide it wasn't possible?*"**

Iúna: **"It's possible now. *If they can splice eSyrup with a microcolony of bacteria, then we can figure out how to splice eSyrup into bigger, more complex living things. And if building these creatures is part of our religious practice...*"**

Iúna: **"*...then we have much stronger grounds to deny oversight by Space Consortium, or any national government!*"**

### Page 1

**"2067: Ushuaia, Argentina"**

We see a bustling harbour town, everything about it small and cute except for the occassional warehouse factory or modern high rise office building - these were clearly very recent additions to a place that otherwise hadn't changed very much in many hundreds of years.

**"When growing a personal supply of eSyrup, say, for research or for fun, you can feed it enough silica just by running down to the beach once a week with a soup bowl."**

**"Industrialized eSyrup production, however, needs quite a bit of silica."**

**"Sand mining was out of the question, given the Space Consortium's concern with their image - wouldn't want their brand tarnished by news of their operations destroying delicate coastal ecosystems or picturesque beachside communities."**

**"So they turned to the next biggest source of biogenic silica - deep-sea deposits in the [Antarctic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biogenic_silica#Major_silica_sinks_in_the_modern_oceans)."**

We see close-ups of the [wildlife at Cabo de Hornos](https://youtu.be/06LcgVQg7Yk) with tumultuous ocean and raw, mountainous landscape. Off in the distance, we see a tiny speck on the horizon - a deep-sea silica mining rig. A tiny plume of smoke, looking both innocent and foreboding, curls up from the rig. 

### Page 2

**"Ocean Acidification Monitoring Station, Havana, Cuba"**

Researchers stare in horror at the read-outs of their remote monitoring systems, displayed using a room-sized **INFO-SPHERE**. A hurricane rages outside. 

Technician: **"Dr. Molina! Dr. Molina!"**

Dr. Molina, already looking harried, sticks their head into the room. 

*Hat tip to [Hilda Molina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilda_Molina).*

Dr. Molina: **"¿Qué es?"**

*translation: "What is it?"*

Tech: **"Los niveles de pH en la superficie del océano ... debido a la lluvia!"**

*translation: "The pH levels at the ocean's surface...because of the rain!!"*

Dr. Molina: **"Dios mío...se ha deslizado a 6.9..."**

*translation: "My god...it's slipped down to 6.9..."*

*Cite [this article](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/rising-acidity-in-the-ocean/) and [this paper](https://imedea.uib-csic.es/master/cambioglobal/Modulo_III_cod101608/Tema_8-acidificaciÃ³n/hypoxia%20%26%20OA%20Melzner.pdf).*

### Page 3

**"Thermohaline Circulation Observation Centre, Orkney Islands"**

Dr. Fischmann: **"Members of the UN, thank you for your time today. My name is Dr. Geraldine Fischmann, and I'm head of the environmental monitoring team for the Thermohaline Circulation Observation Collective. The TCOC has been tracking the temperature, salinity, and flow rates of major ocean currents in the North Atlantic for the last 40 years, and we think we have an explanation for recent drop in energy production by the UN-deployed sea turbines."**

A room-sized **INFO-SPHERE** creates photonic representations of several government leaders around the world. Dr. Fischmann, a tall, hook-nosed woman with incredibly built thighs walks through a 3-dimensional video recording of rivers and waterfalls *pouring* off of a glacier into the fjords surrounding it. Overlayed with light are labels with meta data and more in-depth treatments of certain phenomena being shown in the video, appearing when one of the photonic representations of government leaders move their gaze over that part of the video. 

Dr. Fischmann: **"These videos are from 15 years ago, when intensely hot global temperatures caused a significant meltdown of the Greenland Ice Sheet. As you all well remember, this drastic phenomena finally convinced the United States and China to place a meaningful tax on carbon dioxide emissions, and members of the Paris Agreement switched to [marine current power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_current_power) for electricity generation."**

*note: [biggest usage of coal right now is currently for fuel, only 20% is for electricity](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/10/dangerous-global-warming-will-happen-sooner-than-thought-study)- did the world switch to renewables in time?*

The videos switch to another view of the same glacier, but a slightly different coastline. The glacier doesn't seem to be melting, and enormous, thick chunks of [drift ice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drift_ice) clog up the sea like a traffic jam. 

Dr. Fischmann: **"This is the current view of the Greenland, from remote sensor buoys in the Denmark Strait. Normally, the [West Ice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ice) doesn't extend this far south, but we believe the drastic melting 15 years ago triggered a long-term, slow melting of the ice sheet, which has been quietly dumping fresh water into the Greenland Sea."**

Dr. Fischmann: **"The fresh water freezes more readily than the salty sea, resulting in more ice on the ocean's surface. We believe that this greater incidence of pack ice is extending the West Ice so far south that it's blocking major currents that run through the Denmark Strait, causing the reduction in electricity generated by the UN's sea turbines."**

Gov official: **"Can't we just clear the ice, then?"**

Dr. Fischmann: **"It's not so simple. Our [original predictions](https://tethys.pnnl.gov) about the impact of our sea turbines on the marine ecosystem seem to have been...optimistic. The reduction of kinetic energy we are seeing in ocean currents may not be reversible...[if the ocean currents stop entirely](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shutdown_of_thermohaline_circulation), the UK and northern Europe will *freeze*."**

**"São Paulo, Brazil"**

The orderly protest crowds in front of the Laboratório Nacional de Biociências e Saúde Pública are gone, replaced by utter chaos. Everyone on the street is now wearing industrial filter respirators and knee-length rubber water boots - the streets are ankle-deep in polluted, acidic ocean water. Rain, highly dosed with nitric acid, pours from the sky. We see Majhee, fully dressed in protective gear and a breathing mask, weave her way through a crowd and rush into the front door of the research institute. 

**"2 months ago, when an epidemic of [nitrogen dioxide poisoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_dioxide_poisoning)	landed half of the city in hospitals and on oxygen tanks, Felix moved back to Sweden to be with his dying father..."**

**"1 month ago, when all the supermarkets started opening just once a week instead of every day, Breno moved with his mother back to her hometown, just north of Brasilia..."**

**"11 days ago, hours after celebrating the birth of Nimh, the first full mouse spliced with raw eSyrup, Iara was found on a rooftop in Centro, seemingly shot through the skull, but the bullet was never found..."**

### Page 6

Kai, Beatriz, Nova, and Vec are in the same area where they were having a lab meeting, last we saw them - now they are frantically packing lab equipment and eSyrup cultures, and copying research notes then deleting/shredding/destroying them. Off to one side is an unfamiliar older man and a teenaged boy keeping two very young children out of the fray. The teenaged boy looks related to Nova. The two young children look related to the unfamiliar older man and Beatriz, one looking about 6 and the other looking about 3. The little one has short hair, tied into a puffy short ponytail at the very top of her head; the older one has long straight hair that just brushes his shoulders; they both stare at the frantic activity with wide eyes. 

Majhee: **"Precisamos terminar de embalar *agora*."**

*translation: "We need to finish packing **now**."*

Vec pulls aside Majhee. Vec looks incredibly troubled.  

Vec: **"Majhee, o que fazemos com Nimh??"**

*translation: "Majhee, what do we with Nimh??"*

Majhee: **"Qual é a condição dela?"**

*translation: "What's her condition?"*

Vec: **"Seu esofagus e traqueia. Não se juntam corretamente, há um vazamento. Eu não acho que [Sonic Hedgehog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_hedgehog) é um vetor viável, é apenas muito importante, e muito *sensível*!"**

*translation: "Her esophogus and trachea. They didn't join properly, there's a leak. I don't think [Sonic Hedgehog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_hedgehog) is a viable vector, it's just too important, and too **sensitive**!"*

### Page 7

Majhee places a hand on Vec's shoulder to calm him. 

Majhee: **"Que grande vazamento? Podemos remendá-lo?"**

*translation: "How big of a leak? Can we patch it?"*

Vec: **"É fino, mas *longo*, quase todo o comprimento da conexão. Nova quer tentar, mas Kai e Beatriz acho que vai demorar muito tempo."**

*translation: "It's thin but *long*, almost the whole length of the connection. Nova wants to try, but Kai and Beatriz think it will take too long."*

Vec looks emotionally wrecked. 

Vec: **"Eu vou ajudar a nova, se *você* acha que é uma boa idéia.

*translation: "I will help Nova, if **you** think it's a good idea."*

Majhee stares at the pouring rain outside, the streets below awash with sea water, lost belongings, and garbage. People with insufficient protection from the nitric acid heavy rain are screaming and bleeding. After a long silence, Majhee speaks softly.

Majhee: **"Mesmo que consertemos o vazamento, como vamos transportar um rato transgênico morrendo através de [chuva e inundação de ácida](http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg1/WG1AR5_SPM_FINAL.pdf)?"**

*translation: "Even if we fix the leak, how will we transport a dying transgenic mouse through [acid rain and flood](http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg1/WG1AR5_SPM_FINAL.pdf)?"*

Majhee: **"Dê a ela 20 microlitros de [Sodium Pentobarbital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentobarbital#Euthanasia), e enviar todos os nossos dados para a Suécia. Felix terá mais tempo para experimentar."**

*translation: "Give her 20 microliters of [Sodium Pentobarbital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentobarbital#Euthanasia), and send all of our data to Sweden. Felix will have more time to experiment."*

### Page 8

Majhee turns back to the rest of the room and greets the older man with a hug and a kiss on the cheek. He gives Majhee a tired smile. 

Majhee: **"Que bom que está aqui, Demetrio, como está?"**

*translation: "Glad you're here, Demetrio, how are you?"*

Demetrio: **"Assim como um pode ser, dada a situação."**

*translation: "As well as one can be, given the situation."*

Majhee hugs the teenaged boy. 

Majhee: **"E Amana, todo bem?"**

*translation: "And Amana, you alright?"*

Amana looks terrified, and nearly crying from the effort of keeping his cool in front of the smaller children. 

Amana: **"Dr. Suh, onde estamos indo?"**

*translation: "Dr. Suh, where are we going?"*

### Page 9

Majhee squats to be eye level with the two little children, and gathers them and Amana around her. Demetrio crouches behind the two little ones and places a comforting hand on the boy's shoulder. Majhee smiles extra brightly at the little girl. 

Majhee: **"Então! Nicola, Nerio, vamos caminhar *muito longe*, para uma montanha com um *parte superior lisa*, como uma mesa! *Mas*, no caminho, a *chuva* é *lava*, eo *ar* é lava, por isso precisamos manter a lava *fora* de nossas peles, *não importa o que*. Me entende?"**

*translation: "So! Nicola, Nerio, we are going walk *very far*, to a mountain with a *flat top*, like a table! *But*, on the way, the *rain* is *lava*, and the *air* is lava, so we need to keep the lava *off* of our skins, *no matter what*. Do you understand?"**

Nicola squeels and smiles shyly, raising her arms and hiding her face in her father's knee. Nerio nods somber-faced, one hand on his father's other knee. 

Majhee shifts her attention to Amana. 

Majhee: **"Lembras-te do nosso último retiro de laboratório, quando fomos mergulhar? Você vai vir comigo para trazer as roupas de mergulho aqui."**

*translation: "Do you remember our last lab retreat, when we all went SCUBA diving? You're gonna come with me to bring the wetsuits up here."*

### Page 10

**"In the year 2067, the safety valves on the Space Consortium's deep-sea silica harvesting rig in the Antarctic failed to activate, spewing partially distilled volcanic fumes and biogenic silica, heavy with silicon tetraflouride, into the southern ocean currents. The disaster belched a huge cloud of hydrogen flouride into the [West Wind Drift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctic_Circumpolar_Current), mixing the highly corrosive gas into an already critically damaged atmosphere, and lowering the pH of an already fatally acidic ocean."**

*In volcanic fumes, [silicon tetrafluoride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_tetrafluoride) forms [hexafluorosilicic acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexafluorosilicic_acid), which can further hydrolyze to [hydroflouric acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrofluoric_acid).*

**"The poisonous cloud choked and blinded most of the rig's crew, and the hydroflouric acid burned anyone who fell into the ocean. The catastrophe killed 32 people and sank the harvesting rig into the sea. For weeks, the silican tetraflouride plumes belched unchecked into the Antarctic Convergence."**

**"Everyone fled underground, trying to hide from the huge clouds of poisonous gas and acid rain that were sweeping around the globe in terrifyingly [large and increasingly frequent cyclones](http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg1/WG1AR5_SPM_FINAL.pdf)."**

Over a backdrop of the "Earth as a marble in space" image, showing intense cyclonic activity, we see:
* Majhee leading her research team as they get their first glimpse of the [Mato Grasso Plateau](https://www.britannica.com/place/Mato-Grosso-Plateau), all of them completely covered in neoprene and goggles and breathing masks and rubber boots. 
* Iúna and her son João queue in line to beg asylum in caves in Vermont to escape the poisonous atmosphere. They are both well covered in Iúna's best eSyrup textiles. Other people aren't so lucky. 

### Page 11

**"Amid the chaos, nearly 60,000 planetside humans fled into orbit on the Space Consortium's Space Barges."**

A huge crowd of desperate people try to shove themselves onto four enormous Space Barges, but it's clear that even these behemoth vessels will not fit everyone in the launch station. The Space Barge launch station staff try to maintain order but everyone is in a hysterical panic. Three of the Space Barges have already closed their doors, their energy cells glowing as they prepare to climb up the eSyrup-doped [elevator cable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_elevator#Climbers). 

There are nearly 10 additional empty [launch tracks](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/people-are-still-trying-build-space-elevator-180957877/) but they are all empty.   

Person in the crowd: **"Why aren't the other barges coming back???"**

The last Space Barge begins to close its doors. People totally lose their shit. 

PA: **"Please step away from the safety barrier!! Please step AWAY from the safety barrier!!"**

**"Afraid to take on more refugees than they could safely host in orbit, the Space Consortium shut down the Space Barge shuttle service, 'until further notice'."**

### Page 12

**"That 'further notice' came 23 years later, when the Orbiters, facing a terrible food shortage, returned to Earth to declare themselves, *'The World Government'*."**

## Chapter 3: A Fearful Trill of Things Unknown but Longed for Still

Character designs: Asoka Morei, Iri, Eireena McLeland, Serena Ramirez, Fili Jackson

### Page 1

4 jagged panels. 1st POV of running, terrified, through a harsh and rocky landscape. Flash of memory: enormous fangs; cold, blood-red eyes. A farming village in ruins, fires consuming the large interconnected home structures and surrounding greenhouses. Dead bodies, mangled by the monstrous wolf-like creatures that are the size of a small elephant. 

Asoka trips, falling face veil down in the dirt. Their mechapet, a synthetic creature made to look like a cuttlefish and brought alive using eSyrup technology, chitters frantically from where it is wrapped around Asoka's neck, sheet-white with fear. Asoka's clothes are drenched in fear sweat, gloves torn, face veil reflecting a face of terror and horror. Everything is covered in dust and dirt. 

Asoka: *"Mom...Pippa...WHY??"*

We see Asoka clench their fist, then throw up their head, struggle to stand, eyes streaming with tears. 

Asoka: *"Must...reach...the next...Haven!"*

### Page 2

**"Earlier that morning..."**

**"2116: Green Haven Howes, North America"**

We see a fist holding a bunch of wheat straws, and another hand reaching for a straw. 

Pippa, off-panel: **"*Aw, *seriously*?*"**

We see a crowd of Biononymous children gathered in a outdoor pavilion with a dirt floor, all wearing the compulsory clothing of their cult: a simple sleeveless shirt tucked into baggy trousers in the style of [shalwar kameez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shalwar_kameez); a light long sleeve jacket, loose and fastening up the front, covered in a variety of simple geometric embroidery patterns, sleeves cinched at the wrists; gloves tucked into the sleeves; head veil with identical cartoon schematics of a face embroidered onto each with eSyrup thread; boots, with the trousers tucked in. Each child also has an eSyrup mechapet curled around their arms, legs, necks; sitting on heads, shoulders; or eagerly following their heels. Some of the children have straws of varying lengths in their hands. One child, smaller than the rest of the other children, a mechapet shaped like an American Crow sitting on their shoulder, is holding a very short straw, and the face on their head veil is a definite pout. 

Pippa: **"*I did the far hill field *yesterday*!*"**

Biononymous child holding the fist of straws: **"*Come on Pippa, we all agreed we would pick by straws today.*"**

Pippa: **"*But it's not fair, Io! I'm the smallest, and it's so far away!*"**

Io: **"*We all agreed!*"**

We see tiny gloved hands try to shove the short straw back into an only slightly larger fist of straws. 

Pippa: **"*Take it back, let me pick again!*"**

A taller, lankier Biononymous child, a cuttlefish mechapet curled around their neck, steps in between them and calmly separates them. 

Asoka: **"*Come on, Pippa, I'll help you.*"**

### Page 3

Asoka and Pippa roll two large plastic barrels on a grassy path up a steep, terraced hill, towards a long row of tall greenhouses. The barrels are heavy with water and the two children lean their whole bodies into the endeavor. The cuttlefish mechapet holds two large woven shade-fans over the children's heads, while the crow mechapet moves sticks and other obstacles out of their path. 

Pippa: **"*No, *Soka-aa*, Io was cheating, I know it! They haven't had to work further away than the apple trees ever since we started trying out all of their 'work assignment algorithms'...*"**

Asoka: **"*It's only been a week...maybe you've just had bad luck?*"**

Pippa: **"*Why do *I* always have the bad luck? Can't it go bother someone else sometime?*"**

At the top of the path, slightly above the row of greenhouses, is a row of spigots with hose attachments. Asoka is carefully placing their barrel against a rusted metal barrel holder. Pippa, whose barrel is already placed in a barrel holder, is crouched in front of their barrel, struggles with the hose attachments to their barrel. 

Pippa: **"*These are always so hard to do with gloves...*"**

Asoka gives Pippa a wink and a thumbs up before tending to their own hose attachment.

Asoka: **"*You got this!*"**

### Page 4

Asoka: **"*Wanna know a secret to making your luck better?*"**

Pippa: **"*Yes!*"**

Asoka: **"*Before picking a straw, or rolling dice, think of the worst possible outcome.*"**

Pippa: **"*The worst?!*"**

Asoka: **"*Then think about how you would get what you want even if you had the worst luck, and shout in your head, 'I don't care if the worst happens! I can handle it!!'*"**

### Page 5

Asoka: **"*Then the bad luck gets scared, and knows it can't have fun with you.*"**

The two children watch the water flow through the gravity-powered aquaduct system, gently scattering moisture onto the plants inside the greenhouse. 

Asoka: **"*Smells like Jeshua's making butter buns today...*"**

Pippa looks miserable. 

Pippa: **"*We're so far away, they'll be cold by the time we get back. Why do we have a grove all the way up here anyway?*"**

Asoka smiles kindly via their face veil. 

Asoka: **"*Some of these plants need more sun than they'd get in the valley...*"**

Asoka crouches to be face level with Pippa.

Asoka: **"*If I take care of the weeding, will you run back now and bring me a hot bun?*"**

Pippa beams with joy and gratitude. 

Pippa: **"*Really? Yes!*"**

Pippa runs off, crow mechapet flying overhead. 

Pippa: **"*Thanks Soka! Come on Manut!*"**

### Page 6

Asoka looks at their cuttlefish mechapet, hands resolutely on their hips. 

Asoka: **"*Alright, Iri, let's do this!*"**

Iri chirps with happy determination, holding up weeding trowels in its arms in a celebratory gesture. 

Iri: **"Yeah!"**

Panels show Asoka and Iri weeding the plants in the greenhouse. Have some nice botany spreads of future plants that have been genetically engineered to deal with a heavy NO2, CO2, and CH4 (Methane) content. The plants need to have ways of reducing their overgrowth thanks to the abundance of CO2 and they need to still sequester enough nutrients for them to be worth growing and eating. What do the 3 sisters (beans, corn, squash) need to change in order to still be a great trio?

### Page 7

Asoka: **"*All done!*"**

Asoka wipes their brow. 

Asoka: **"*We must've worked fast if Pippa's still not back--*"**

Suddenly Iri shrieks and goes completely white. Iri begins loudly broadcasting in the generic synthetic voices used by the Biononymous outside the privacy of their home structures. 

Iri: **"*This is an emergency broadcast from Green Haven Howes, we are under attack! Repeat, *WE ARE UNDER ATTACK*--Aaaaaaaaahh!!!---(scream cuts off with a sickening gurgle)*"**

Iri collapses into a grey puddle as Asoka rushes over, face veil revealing their terror. 

Asoka: **"*Attack?!*"**

Asoka scoops up Iri and begins running down the valley, but Iri suddenly re-animates and broadcasts another voice not its own. 

Iri: **"Soka, stay away, don't come back!!"**

Asoka clutches Iri to their chest, looking down the mountainside with terrified eyes at the sight of enormous beasts, moving impossibly fast, tearing through their village, aghast to hear...

Asoka: **"*Mom??!!*"**

Iri/Soka's Mom: **"It's the **BEASTS**!! Run Soka! *RUN!!*"**

### Page 8

It's night. A village with a central housing structure identical to Asoka's home village, also surrounded by greenhouses, sleeps tranquilly amongst rolling hills and a soft, nearly full moon. A faint orange glow is visible in one corner of the central housing structure. 

Eireena, off-panel: **"I'm so sorry for your loss, Asoka."**

Inside, Asoka is kneeling, head bowed. They are wearing clean trousers and sleeveless shirt, but their feet, hands, and head are bare. Asoka's long reddish hair is tied back in a half ponytail, and Iri, now displaying a reddish back and cream coloured bottom to better camouflage from its perch on Asoka's neck, peers out from under Asoka's hair. Before Asoka is a large steaming mug of hot tea, but Asoka hasn't touched it. Tears run down their face, past an upper lip that shows just the tiniest hints of fuzzy hair. 

We see Eireena McLeland, High Priestess of the Biononymous and leader of this Green Haven, a tiny woman, silver haired, wrinkled face showing deep sorrow, sitting on a floor cushion and wearing an elaborately embroidered jacket. On either side of her sit two other adult Biononymous: a man and a woman, somewhat younger than Eireena. The man looks at Asoka, his dark face betraying heartbroken sympathy for Asoka and anxious worry about the situation as a whole. The woman's face, half-hidden behind long, thick, gently curling dark hair, is one of calm contemplation. 

They are all sitting inside a warmly lit room with a shrine centered along one wall. All of the walls are covered in tapestries, made with the finest of the Biononymous' textile and embroidery. The shrine is a figure dressed in the religious clothing of the Biononymous, legs folded into a lotus and one hand raised, akin to the Buddha, but instead of holding the palm forward, the wrist is bent and the palm is cupped, just enough to hold a bit of soil and a tiny seedling, just beginning to sprout. In front of the seated figure is a large black bird, carved out of wood and delicately painted, with long legs and a horn-like feather sticking out of its forehead -- a [horned screamer, *Anhima cornuta*](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=horned+screamer+anhima+cornuta&t=opera&iar=images&iax=images&ia=images). The figurine is surrounded by non-combusting eSyrup candles and scent-only eSyrup incense, and mid-summer blossoms. 

Eireena: **"I don't think any of the Biononymous anticipated that very many other animals would survive The Burning, especially large carnivores...it's quite strange, actually...but we will need to consider how to protect the Green Havens from these '**BEASTS**'."**

### Page 9

The fabric flap to this room opens, and another Biononymous adult enters. He addresses Eireena.

Biononymous man: **"Apologies, High Priestess, but World Government Peacekeepers have just arrived. They request an audience with you immediately."**

The other woman, sitting beside Eireena, raises an eyebrow. Her eye has a hard glint.  

Biononymous woman: **"Immediately? At this indecent hour?"** 

Eireena: **"It's alright, Serena. Charlie, please let the Peacekeepers know I'll be with them shortly."**

Charlie bows and exits. Eireena stands and looks down at Asoka, who is still kneeling with their head down, unable to look up or stand, tears streaming down their face. 

Eireena: **"It seems these days are full of the strange and the indecent. Asoka has sanctuary with us, but perhaps it would be best to keep their presence here...discreet."**

Eireena puts on her face veil. 

Eireena: **"*Fili, please escort Asoka to the infirmary and see to their needs. Serena, please come with me.*"**

Fili and Serena both bow: **"Yes, High Priestess."**

### Page 10

It is the next morning. Asoka sits on the edge of their bed in the infirmary, a thick, sturdy mattress in the style of Japanese futons, on a [tatami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatami)-style floor. Asoka's bare feet are on the tatami, knees bent up under their folded arms, in which they rest their head. Their eyes are tired and puffy. Iri tenderly combs Asoka's hair with its arms. 

Fili pushes back the door tapestry to Asoka's room, carrying a tray of food. Fili is also barefoot and without his face veil or jacket. 

Fili: **"Good morning. Did you sleep at all?"**

Asoka, without looking up, straightens their back and lowers their knees into a cross-legged sitting position. They look too dejected to talk. Iri timidly peers at Fili from around Asoka's hair. 

Iri: **"We slept a little."**

Fili sets down the tray and sits across from Asoka, whose eyes have started to leak tears again. Fili looks at Asoka sadly, then gives a little smile. 

Fili: **"Fresh raspberries? Just picked them this morning."**

Asoka still shows no reaction. Fili's smile drops and he looks down. 

Fili: **"I have a child about your age...I can't imagine them going through what you've gone through...It's ok to feel pain, but please, you must eat. It would dishonour your entire Haven if you were to starve yourself to death."**

Asoka finally looks at Fili. After a moment, Asoka reaches for a raspberry. Fili smiles encouragingly. 

### Page 11

A scratch at the door. Eireena enters with Serena. Fili stands and bows. Asoka also stands, abruptly remembering their manners, and knocks over the raspberries. Asoka looks mortified. 

Asoka: **"Oh no! I'm so sorry!"**

Asoka rushes to pick up the scattered raspberries. Eireena holds up a hand to stop Asoka and smiles wryly as Serena calmly gathers the rest of the raspberries, which mostly scattered in her direction anyway. 

Eireena: **"Please, eat those, and sit."**

Serena returns the raspberries to their bowl, and they all sit, Asoka on their bed futon and obediently shoving a raspberry into their mouth, the others on sitting cushions. 

Eireena: **"Asoka, I want to tell you why the Peacekeepers visited us last night. Is this something you think you can hear right now?"**

Asoka looks at Eireena, suddenly scared. The raspberries in Asoka's hand have been crushed by their sudden tension.

Eireena: **"If you hear what I have to say, and all you want is to hide some place safe for the rest of your life, I guarantee that you will have that place with us. Do you understand?"**

Asoka nods: **"Yes"**

### Page 12

Eireena: **"Good. Last night, Lieutenant Colonel Santiago Garcia of the World Government Peacekeepers told the Green Haven Clarksville Council that he has received multiple reports of the Green Havens being attacked by large wolf-like creatures."**

A panel of flashback: the salivating fangs, the terribly cold eyes, a sense of impossibly fast movement for something so large. 

Eireena: **"The Colonel claims that although they can track these creatures, the creatures move too quickly for the Peacekeepers to hunt them down. Nonetheless, he offered to station a platoon of 40 Peacekeepers at our Green Haven as protection, in case the creatures try to attack us."**

Eireena lets her cynicism creep onto her face. 

Eireena: **"I can't say that we can trust their motives at all, but we have little choice...your story confirms the terrifying results of having no protection against these '**BEASTS**'. So we will have Peacekeepers at our Green Haven, and soon, I fear that no Green Haven will be without World Government military presence. I don't think I need to say how much this will compromise our dedication to anonymity and a life free from surveillance."**

Eireena now looks hard at Asoka. 

Eireena: **"If you take your sanctuary with us, this is the life we forsee having to accept. However...if you feel able to travel a more dangerous and risky, but potentially more rewarding path...there is another option."**

### Page 1

We are deep underwater. An enormous [Columbia-class](https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2017/09/3-questions-americas-next-nuclear-missile-submarine/141317/) [submarine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia-class_submarine) slips through the dark blue water. A long thin cable full of [hydrophones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrophone) [trails out behind the sub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_Towed_Array_Sensor_System). On the side of the submersible are the letters ["SSBN-831"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_submarines_of_the_United_States_Navy), the hull number of the [USS *Monterey*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_code_831), which has now been comandeered for use by the World Government Peacekeepers, the planetside branch of the World Government military. On the ocean floor below, a [remotely operated underwater vehicle(ROV)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remotely_operated_underwater_vehicle) has been [digging up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submarine_communications_cable#Cable_repair) a [submarine cable](https://www.submarinecablemap.com/#/), [no bigger than a garden hose](https://www.pri.org/stories/2015-04-20/what-links-global-internet-wires-inside-tubes-no-bigger-garden-hose), from the ocean floor and feeding it back up towards the USS *Monterey*, where the cable disappears into the bottom of the submarine. The ROV has just cut the cable. We see Iri's shimmering outline against the submarine bottom. 

Iri, off-panel: *"It's done!"*

Asoka, off-panel: *"Finally! How is the [cable engine](http://www.simec-technologies.com/upload/galerie/fiche-mac-2016-97297.pdf) louder than the whole [engine room of a submarine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia-class_submarine#Electric_drive)?"*

Iri, off-panel: *"Too bad the cuttlefish cloth doesn't let you swim out here with me..."*

Asoka, off-panel: *"Don't rub it in..."*

### Page 2

We see the inside of the submarine's [bilge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilge), the lowest compartment of the submarine, knee-high with liquid drain-off from all parts of the submersible. On an oily pipe, we see two bootprints, and a ghostly hand print on the wall next to it. Thanks to the dirty water, we see an outline of the fully camouflaged Asoka, crouching on top of the pipe and trying to make as little contact with the water below as possible. 

Asoka: *"...I really hope cuttlefish cloth is easy to clean..."*

We see Iri riding the ROV back into the submarine via an escape portal being used to let the robot in and out of the sub. 

Asoka: *"Can you check on the [Navigator](http://navyformoms.ning.com/group/submoms/page/meet-the-crew-of-a-submarine) once you're inside?"*

Iri, off-panel: *"I bet he's still playing cards..."*

We see Iri, shimmering with invisibility, as it carefully sneaks through the tight submarine hallways towards the command deck and the senior rating's mess at the fore of the submarine. 

### Page 3

*THIS PAGE STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION*

We see Iri clinging invisibly to the ceiling of the command deck. Below Iri, Peacekeepers stand at workstations that look like mega-industrial versions of the **INFO-SPHERE** desk we saw Iúna using back in 2066. 

*Need to consult with someone who knows how a naval vessel works and what kinds of daily activities would happen on board.*

Peacekeeper 1: **"This heat is brutal...you can tell we're only 6 degrees north of the Red Zone..."**

*The Red Zone extends throughout the region between the [Tropic of Cancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropic_of_Cancer) and the [Tropic of Capricorn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropic_of_Capricorn).*

Peacekeeper 2: **"I'd rather be out here than back in those marsh caves! Eeugh, the smell!!"**

Peacekeeper 3: **"I feel a little bad about re-supplying off them...they don't seem to have much space to grow food..."**

Peacekeeper 2: **"Well, we either take their food or we starve as soon as we pass the Bahamas!"**

Peacekeeper 1: **"(snort) You'd think the quartermaster would have rationed our food more accurately..."**

Iri: *"I hope you grabbed enough food to last the rest of the journey...they might be keeping a closer eye on the galley from here on out..."*

### Page 4

Asoka, kneeling, stares glumly at the filthy water around them. 

Asoka: *"This isn't what I expected..."*

*--flashback--*

**"5 days ago..."**

We are back at Green Haven Clarksville, the morning after Asoka arrived and begged for sanctuary. 

Eireena: **"Serena overheard some of the Peacekeeper's talking -- apparently, stationing troops at the Green Havens wasn't Lieutenant Colonel Garcia's original mission. He's actually on his way to the Red Zone, to a location in the former Amazon Rainforest, where the World Government's satellites have captured images of what looks like *humans*."** 

Serena: **"They're, apparently, *re-growing* the forest. And instead of showing the appropriate *awe* for *anyone* who could do that, the Peacekeepers were going on about how much 'exotic fruit' they were going to be able to bring back home. *Idiots*. Don't they realise what killed the forest in the first place?"**

### Page 5

Serena: **"They said the humans were *naked*. If an entire amphibious warship, full of pirate-minded soldiers, wasn't on its way to exploit the shit out of these people, I would say it's a hilarious joke. *Naked*, in the Red Zone?? Most of our best textiles can't keep you alive in the Red Zone for much longer than a day, there's so much heat and poison in the air...it's *crazy*..."**

Serena: **"But if it's true...imagine what powerful allies they could be...!"**

Eireena coughs discreetly and gives Serena a sharp look, then turns to Asoka.

Eireena: **"This morning, we convened an emergency High Council, linking together every Biononymous Green Haven in the Northern Hemisphere. There are...*conflicting*...opinions, as to whether we should try to make contact with these people before the World Government does. In the end, we decided to leave the choice up to *you*."**

Asoka and Iri realise that everyone is looking at them. They exchange a glance. 

Asoka: **"Me? Why would you do that?"**

Serena: **"You're the only one allowed to wear it."**

Asoka: **"Wear what?"**

Eireena: **"Eat the raspberries in your hand, and come with me please. Bring the oatcakes and juice."**

### Page 6

Eireena leads the way, flanked by Serena and Asoka. Iri, feeling bolder, is now balanced on top of Asoka's head, who dutifully eats oatcakes and drinks juice. Fili walks behind them. Asoka and Iri take comfort in the embroidered tapestry lining the hallways, depicting familiar passages and stories from Biononymous scripture.

Eireena: **"I used to be a materials engineer, before The Burning. I was working as part of an international project to create affordable, easy-to-use eSyrup water and air filters, working with an incredible woman, who owned a textile manufacturing company. We perfected the process of doping natural fibers with eSyrup, so that we could make the finest, softest of organzas, with exceptional filtration properties and very simple voltage-treatment protocols. It was a beautiful time for science."**

Eireena: **"We wove miles and miles of this eSyrup thread into filters that we gave away for free, to anyone who needed it! It was grand. I have such fond memories of late nights, talking over drinks about how body mods were just embedding all these trackable, *hackable* devices right into our bodies, with no option to get off the radar! It was gonna ruin society, we were very convinced."**

Eireena: **"But there *are* some undeniable advantages to having powerful technology right at your fingertips. And we were discovering that our organzas were capable of so much more than just filtering the water and the air. So we decided that we needed to keep the option for living without body mods on the table, by researching *alternatives* to body mods, and the only way to do *that* was to create a religion, because in those days, religions had the best defense against government interference."**

### Page 7

Eireena: **"But then The Burning happened, and everyone we feared much abandoned us anyway, on a planet that *they'd* trashed."**

Serena: **"Until they came back to demand food, fuel, and whatever the hell they wanted...not much has changed."**

Eireena pulls back a tapestry, which, to a naive eye looks no different from any of the other wall tapestries in terms of its function. But behind this tapestry is another small room. Inside is a tall wooden dresser. Eireena holds the tapestry open and gestures everyone inside before her. 

Eireena: **"Please."**

Fili opens the tall wooden dresser. Inside is an exquisite outfit of the Biononymous, embroidered in elaborate tiny patterns and dressed on a flat mannequin. Neatly folded in the bottom of the dresser is a utility belt on top of a large cloth satchel. Asoka looks closer and gasps -- the tiny patterns are in the style of their home Haven! Asoka reaches with their hand, then hesitates. 

Asoka: **"May I?"**

Fili: **"It's yours."**

### Page 8

Asoka lifts the jacket off the mannequin, reverently running their hands over the stitches, the weave, the hem. As Asoka does this, the cloth responds to their touch. 

Asoka: **"This is *beautiful*. Where did it come from?"**

Fili: **"Many years ago, two members of your Green Haven council visited us, with this magnificent wooden dresser, and a beautiful child's outfit made of the finest eSyrup cloth we had ever seen. Your Councilors showed us the faces of the Green Haven Howes children, then asked us to safeguard this outfit, and never show it to anyone, unless a child from their Haven should ever have to beg us for sanctuary."**

Eireena: **"It's called 'cuttlefish cloth', a new kind of eSyrup textile that can be 'voltage-treated' by the electrical activity of your nervous system. It can extend your homeostatic range -- help you survive both colder and hotter environments, filter and purify insanely dirty water or air, and withstand an enormous amount of radiation. With practice, it can even camouflage its wearer *completely*, making you, more or less, *invisible*."**

Serena's eyes twinkle. 

Serena: **"And it's powered by your waste products."**

Asoka: **"Wait, what??"**

### Page 9

Serena's eyes never waver, face inscrutable. 

Serena: **"Everything that passes through your gut is processed by your enteric nervous system, a network of *500 million* neurons - that's *5 times* as many as the neurons in your *spine*. You'd do well to respect what you eat, cuz now that's also powering your protective bubble against the world."**

Serena grins now. 

Serena: **"Besides, the first outfit was for a little one just barely able to walk -- it needed to be a diaper too! It's basically a body-diaper! It uses your waste and gives you protection, a poop-powered safety bubble..."**

Asoka looks horrified. Eireena hides her smile. 

Eireena: **"Anyways, every year since then, different members of your Council have visited us, each time showing us the faces of a child, or grandchild, and bringing a new outfit, a little bit larger each time, and taking back the old one."**

Eireena: **"And last year, I got a visit from my old friend, who told me about her grandchild, and showed me *your* face. Iúna told me that, even though she was supposed to be making this outfit for *any* child of Green Haven Howes, she was thinking *most* of *you*."**

Asoka: **"So you knew my avó Iúna!"**

Eireena smiles broadly. 

Eireena: **"Yes."**

### Page 10

Asoka stares down at the cuttlefish cloth. 

Asoka: **"Are the...**BEASTS**...and the Peacekeepers...part of why avó was bringing you this outfit in secret?"**

Asoka looks pained. 

Asoka: **"And...if it was supposed to save the children of Green Haven Howes...how come there's only *one*??"**

Eireena drops the smile, and Serena's face darkens. Fili has tears in his eyes, jaw clenched.

Eireena: **"This research would be incredibly dangerous in the hands of someone willing to exploit others...if the World Government found out about it, they wouldn't be using their military just to *intimidate* us into giving them more *food*."**

Asoka suddenly remembers -- the snarls, the screams, the smell of freshly baked bread...

Asoka looks up to see everyone patiently waiting for them to recover from the flashback. 

Eireena places a hand on Asoka's shoulder, gentle but grim. 

Eireena: **"Like I said before, if you want to live a quiet life in hiding, you can have that here at Green Haven Clarksville."**

### Page 11

Eireena: **"But with an outfit made of cuttlefish cloth, you're protected from both the World Government *and* any surface environment on this planet, even the Red Zone. The one who wears this outfit will be the most anonymous, the most free, and the only one who has *any* chance of delivering an offer of alliance to these people in the Amazon."**

Eireena: **"If you accept this outfit, the High Council beg you to also accept this diplomatic mission: to warn the people in the Amazon of the Peacekeeper's intentions, and offer them alliance with the Biononymous. In return, we will provide you with everything you need to travel to the Amazon, and the Biononymous will trust you with our collective voice."**

*--end flashback--*

*HERE UNTIL END OF CHAPTER STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION*

We're back in the double-layered hull of the amphibious warship. Asoka kneels, staring down at the food spilling out of their invisible satchel, lost in thought. 

Iri: *"Soka?"*

Asoka: *"Hmm?"*

Iri: *"I'm on the bridge, they're discussing the location! Put up your face veil!"*

### Page 12

Asoka pulls the fabric back across their face, and sees the world through Iri's eyes. Up on the command deck, a large **INFO-SPHERE** displays a map of the Americas, a glowing blue line tracing a the ship's path down the eastern coast of North America. At the latitude of Gainesville, Florida, the line becomes a tiny glowing dock landing ship made of light. A blue dotted line extends south from the tiny glowing ship of light, swerving east to avoid the flooded remains of the Bahamas, the Turks and Caicos Islands, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, and the western most curve of the Caribbean Islands, to then hug the coasts of Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, and finally, the Amapá state of Brazil, bordered to the southeast by a great river delta -- there the dotted line curves intimately inland, wiggling up the Amazon River until it terminates in a second, more ghostly little ship made of light, nearly halfway across the continent to the Pacific coast. This little ship of light sprouts a dark brown line that shoots almost exactly north for a seemingly tiny distance, then terminates in a blinking, glowing 'X'. 

Asoka: **"So. That's where we're going."**

## Chapter 5: Lilacs Out Of The Dead Land

Character designs: Asoka Morei, Iri, Minka Oosou

### Page 1 

**"The Red Zone was once called 'the tropics', a band of the Earth's surface bounded in the north by the Tropic of Cancer, and at its southern edge by a similarly outdated name, the Tropic of Capricorn. Even in the heart of winter, 'the tropics' had over 10 hours of daylight, something that, at one time, made it irresistable to conquerers, colonists, imperialists, and ex-pats alike."**

**"They came for the clear blue waters full of iridescent fish and fascinatingly complex coral reefs; extravagant, multi-coloured birds-of-paradise and thrillingly powerful felines in enormous, lush forests; and rich soils teeming with plants that move and insects that wage war. But these [jewels of biodiversity](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2013/oct/23/new-species-amazon-rainforest-in-pictures) were far more delicate and fragile than they looked. By the time the Global Water Crisis hit, much of what made 'the tropics' so lovely and desirable was gone."**

Under this narration, we see Asoka and Iri, shimmering with invisibility, looking back over a rocky outcrop to the north of the flooded, abandoned ruins of Manaus, full moon big in the night sky, as they head into the forest, quick and nimble, carrying only Asoka's cuttlefish-cloth satchel, which is mostly empty. Below, the Peacekeepers unload vehicles, supplies, and equipment from the dock landing ship and set up a large, noisy, destructive camp on another outcropping along the north edge of the ruins. 

### Page 2

**"Nowadays, temperatures in the Red Zone become fatally hot during the day, and any living thing without protection during those hours withers away into dust."**

Asoka: *"Ok Iri, how many hours until sunrise?"*

Iri: *"Probably only 4...I wish we'd had a chance to grab more food..."*

Asoka: *"We're just gonna have to manage. So! I say we run for at least 3 hours before looking for someplace to hide from the sun."*

Iri: *"Just remember, you've been crawling in between the walls of a double-hulled warship for the last 28 days--"*

Asoka is already running, Iri clinging to their neck for dear life. 

Asoka: *"Yeah, so?"*

Iri: *"So you might be out of shape!"*

As Asoka runs, their face veil shows them overlays of annotations about the environment around them. What happens to the Amazon in 100 years, after massive deforestation, brutal heat, CO2 and NO2 heavy atmosphere, and NO2 acid rain decimate most of the life, and then someone comes along and is starting to re-grow the forest?

In addition the annotations about the flora around them, Asoka's face veil shows two temperature readings, one for the environment inside Asoka's clothes, and one for the outside environment. The outside temp is currently 36.2 deg celsius, while the temp inside Asoka's clothes is 23.1. 

Asoka's face veil also shows the atmospheric content in a dynamically changing pie chart. By the flooded ruins of Manaus, with its many dead trees and vegetation, [the methane content is quite high](https://petri.massivesci.com/articles/methane-trees-greenhouse-gas-wetlands/). 

### Page 3

It's the earliest part of dawn - [astronomical dawn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawn#Astronomical_dawn). Asoka leans against a rock to catch their breath. A few scattered groves of [*Vismia guianensis*](https://cloudfront.escholarship.org/dist/prd/content/qt8xs2c9h8/qt8xs2c9h8.pdf?t=ovirno) trees break up the bleak landscape. 

Asoka: *"How...far...??"*

Iri brings up the map they image-captured from the bridge of **WARSHIP**. 

Iri: *"Ummmmm...there!"*

A bright blue ball appears, barely an eighth of the way to the blinking 'X'. Asoka gasps and shakes sweat into the cloth of their head scarf and face veil. The fabric gets damp, but then quickly dries, as if the cloth were drinking up the fluid. The outside temp now reads 39, while the temperature inside Asoka's outfit remains steady at 23. 

Asoka: *"Seriously?? That's it??"*

Iri: *"Sokaaa, don't push yourself too much..."*

Asoka takes off their pack and pulls out a canteen of water. They guzzle the water through their face veil. They place their hand on their belly, and a view of their intestines shows up on their face veil. 

Asoka: *"My guts aren't completely empty yet..."*

Iri: *"But..."*

Zoom in on Asoka's eyes, fiercely determined. 

Asoka: *"We have to get there *first*, Iri!"*

### Page 4

**"Human body cells start to die when body temperatures go above 41 deg celsius, but externally, humans can survive much higher temperatures, even up to 70 deg C, as long as the air is dry and our insides stay hydrated. In humid, tropical air, however, anything above 47 deg is cause for concern, and getting respite from the heat is crucial."**

It is now full and proper sunrise, the sun streaming horizontally between the scattered but significantly more dense trees. These trees are [pioneer species](http://blog.perunature.com/the-great-succession-epic-building-an-amazon-rainforest), fast-growing, sun-loving trees that can [replace the rainforest canopy](http://www.rainforestconservation.org/rainforest-primer/rainforest-primer-table-of-contents/f-forest-maintenance-and-succession/) and allow "climax species" to re-establish themselves in deforested regions. 

The outside temperature now reads 44.6 deg celsius, while the inside temperature has only gone up to 26.3 deg celsius. 

Iri stares open mouthed at the jungle around them.

Iri: *"Wow...!"*

Asoka: *"Cuttlefish cloth is **awesome**! How far are we now?"*

The bright blue ball has moved further north, a little past a quarter of the way to the 'X'. 

Iri gives Asoka a look. 

Iri: *"Do you think...maybe you should eat soon?"*

Asoka: *"If you can find me a cave to eat in, sure. But I want to keep walking...I won't run in this heat, but we **have** to keep going."*

### Page 5

The sun is at its zenith. The air sizzles with heat, but Asoka and Iri are about to reach much denser tree cover. The re-growing forest here is dominated by [slower-growing pioneer species](https://e-reports-ext.llnl.gov/pdf/366224.pdf), including medicinal trees such as [*Vismia baccifera*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vismia_baccifera). 

Asoka quickly trudges into a dense grove, clearly uncomfortable and at the end of their strength. 

Iri: *"Wow, that is **hot!!!**"*

On Asoka's face veil, outside temperature reads 52.8 deg celsius, and the temperature inside their outfit now reads 27.7 deg celsius. A power guage icon flashes a gentle warning -- the outfit's power is low. Asoka's eyes are heavy-lidded, and underneath, dark circles are quite visible.

Asoka: *"Where are we now?"*

The bright blue ball is now just about at the halfway point. Asoka collapses at the foot a tree, sitting in the largest patch of shade they can find, and pulls out their almost empty water canteen. They carefully pour water into their mouth through their face veil. 

Iri: *"This is insane, we **have** to stay in the shade!"*

Asoka: *"Yeah? Ok...in that case, I'll rest a bit..."*

Asoka immediately falls asleep where they sit. Iri dashes over and checks Asoka's vitals by running its arms along Asoka's outfit above their heart, lungs, stomach, and kidneys. As they do, the eSyrup cloth gives Iri readouts of each organs' functional well-being. Satisfied, Iri then starts to gather [Babassu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attalea_speciosa) palm leaves from the forest floor to make into a makeshift sun canopy. 

### Page 6

The sun is setting in the sky, deep red light rays cutting horizontally once more through the trees. Asoka is now sprawled on the ground, fully horizontal underneath Iri's makeshift sun canopy, which is large enough to cover Asoka's full body-length in shade. Several large leaves are drenched in water and wrapped around Asoka.  

*More references for pioneer species in the rainforest and forest restoration: https://globalforestatlas.yale.edu/amazon/conservation-initiatives/forest-restoration*

*More on plants native to the Amazon: http://www.pbs.org/journeyintoamazonia/plants.html*

Asoka suddenly jerks awake, briefly becomes invisible, then relaxes upon seeing Iri calmly standing watch. Asoka sits up, yawns, and streches, then gives Iri a gently accusing look through a face veil that shows the outside temperature to have dropped to 38.2 deg celsius, and Asoka's suit temperature is 23.0.

Asoka: *"You let me sleep more than a few hours."*

Iri hands Asoka their canteen. 

Iri: *"Drink. I found a stream nearby."*

Asoka: *"Thanks..."*

Asoka carefully opens the now completely full canteen and takes a long, grateful sip through their face veil. 

### Page 7

Iri: *"Also, Soka...look around you..."*

Asoka: *"Hmm?"*

Asoka runs their eyes over the trees around them and their face veil labels them as...

Asoka: *"[Papaya](https://www.instagram.com/p/BWs7J_xBYvP/)!"*

*More info on papaya: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papaya*

Asoka runs to the base of a papaya tree as Iri shimmies up the trunk. Iri brings down a large, bulbous fruit, and Asoka holds it reverently as their outfit scans the fruit to check its radiation content and ripeness. Simultaneously, Asoka's outfit checks the atmospheric content of the grove in which Asoka and Iri currently sit. Iri also takes in a huge breath of the air and does an independent analysis. 

Iri: *"You can double-check me, but I think the air in here is actually **breathable**..."*

Asoka's face veil confirms Iri's analysis, and Asoka tears off their face veil in order to ravenously tear into the papaya. Iri joyfully runs up the tree for more of the ripe fruits. 

Asoka: **"Mmmmmm!!!"**

### Page 8

Asoka has eaten their fill of papaya and now looks euphoric. They sprawl at the base of the papaya tree as nautical twilight descends on the forest. Fireflies blink in and out of the blue darkness. The outside temperature has now dropped to 35.1 deg celsius, and the temperature inside Asoka's suit is down to 22.5 deg C. 

Asoka claps their hands and wipes their mouth, abruptly focusing on the cooling night. They put on their face veil and see a view of the world showing the chemical exhalations and radiation signatures of the plants around them, enhancing their vision in the rapidly fading blue light. 

Asoka: *"All right, Iri! Let's do this."*

Asoka crouches, ready to run. They are caught completely unawares by a blurry figure kicking them in the back of the head with a [Meia Lua de Compasso](https://youtu.be/IiLqVCyyoPs).  

The figure squeals with terror. 

Figure: **"Aaauuuuuuggh, é real!!!"**

*translation: "Aaauuuuuuggh, it's real!!!"*

### Page 9

Asoka's entire head scarf and veil have been kicked off entirely, and Asoka is frantically trying to put their head gear back on while hiding their face behind their arms and hair. Iri jumps up onto Asoka to cover their face with its body, becoming visible and puffing itself up as big as it can go, glowing an eery, ghostly white. Iri's belly, smashed up against Asoka's face, displays what Iri sees so that Asoka isn't left blind. 

The figure facing Asoka and Iri is small, dark-skinned, and dressed only in loose, flowing trousers that cinch at the knees and have large open slits down the sides. They crouch in battle-ready pose, menacing Iri with what looks like a short, broad spike of metal curved wickedly at its jagged end. Their eyes are tightly shut, yet they seem to know exactly where Iri seemingly floated above the forest floor. They are sweating and trembling with terror. 

Figure: **"Espírito maligno, fique longe de meus mamões!!"**

*translation: "Evil spirit, stay away from my papaya trees!!"*

Iri: *"They think we're an evil spirit?!"*

Asoka: **"I'm not a spirit, I'm a human!"** 

Asoka holds up their invisible hands in surrender, completely forgetting their camouflage.

Iri: *"Not English, they were speaking Portuguese!"*

The small dark figure rushes at Iri with a blood-curdling yell.

### Page 10

Asoka tries to dodge the dark figure's rush towards them as Iri hardens its arms to parry the metal spike, thrust at it by the dark figure. Undaunted, the dark figure twists their body to deliver an [escorpião kick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_capoeira_techniques#/media/File:Capoeira_Scorpion_kick.gif) and knocks Iri off of Asoka's face. Iri goes flying into a tree trunk and crumples at its base. Asoka, who has managed to get the head scarf back on but hasn't yet put up their face veil, completely forgets to hide their face and runs over to check on Iri. 

Asoka: **"Iri!!!"**

The dark figure now has an unobstructed view of Asoka's head, seemingly floating without any body attached to it. They *freak* out. 

Figure: **"Aaaaaaaahhhh!!"**

Iri is dazed but alright. They shakily climb up Asoka's arm onto their shoulders and places two arms over Asoka's ears. 

Iri: *"You need...Portuguese!"*

Asoka turns off their camou and now, finally fully visible, turns to the dark figure and puts both hands up in a gesture pleading for mercy. 

Asoka: **"Please! Eu sou humano! Eu sou humano!!"**

*translation: "I'm human! I'm human!!"*

The dark figure, eyes still tightly closed, circles Asoka and Iri. They are clearly still terrified, but the hand holding the metal spike is steady. 

Figure: **"O que você quer?!"**

*translation: "What do you want?!"*

### Page 11

Asoka: **"Por favor, há um exército chegando! Eles querem roubar de você e fazer seus escravos!"**

*translation: "Please, there is an army coming! They want to steal from you and make your their slaves!"*

Figure: **"Mentiroso!!"**

*translation: "Liar!!"*

Asoka: **"No! Por favor--"**

Suddenly Asoka notices the ground rumbling gently. 

Figure: **"O que é isso?"**

*translation: "What is it?"*

The rumbling gets louder, heavier, ominously closer. The figure has also noticed, and now looks in the direction of the rumbling, having seemingly lost all interest in Asoka and Iri. 

Figure: **"Merda--!!"**

*translation: "Shit--!!"*

### Page 12

Suddenly a tank plows through the grove of papaya trees, completely destroying everything in its path. Asoka, Iri, and the dark figure scream with terror and frantically get out of the way of the incoming stampede of military vehicles, which pay no mind to anything in their way, be it flora, fauna, or unusual, out-of-place humans and mechapet. 

## Dream 2: Rites of Passage

### Page 1

Bonfires on a warm night. Shadows of well-choreographed ritual dancers, powerful and strong from a lifetime of training, hover warmly, protectively. The view is zoomed out so that we see Min (the dark figure from chapter 5) from above. Min is topless, sitting inside a large, fat metal hoop, a la Cyr Wheel. She is surrounded in many concentric circles of family and friends, all dressed in their most splendid clothing made of cloth infused with one of the AUTOMATA's original, surviving eSyrup cultures, called "Mothers". Everyone in the concentric circles are holding hands and focused on Min, their bodies convulsing in synchronised group ritual dance. 

Drum beats keep everyone synchronised.

**"Another Tree Surfer is born tonight."**

Over this backdrop, small close-up panels are scattered, showing different parts of 16 year old Min, large swaths of skin covered in proudly displayed, ecstatically dancing clan tatoos:   
* an eye, nose, and ear. The eye is determined, steely, and dilated with adrenaline and euphoria. The nose and ear are pierced with eSyrup metal, formed into plain, elegantly raw shapes with rounded edges. The brow is set and only slightly sweaty. The head is shaved and covered in tatoos of her achievements as a clan member and Arborist. 
* a strong and straight back, dominated by an eSyrup tatoo depicting a shallow coral ocean scene, ever-changing.  
* shoulder and neck from the front, collar bone straight in a relaxed line that is perfectly parallel to the bottom edge of the panel. Neck is a bit clenched, and tendrils of Min's back tatoo curl around from her back in comforting, fractal patterns.  
* legs, covered in line art encoding her family lineage, are folded in an easy lotus, covered in the soft folds of ritual clothing appropriate for the ascent of a Journeyhume Arborist to the status of Expert Crafter: Tree Surfer. 

**"To be reborn, each Expert Crafter of the Automata must first retreat to one of the sacred caves and refrain from both speech and food for 7 days. Then, they must accept an injection of *raw eSyrup*."**

**"The raw eSyrup is engineered to look for radioactive proteins that mark the cells that were part of the [ectoderm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ectoderm), the outer layer of the human embryo. Every Automata, being born in the Red Zone, has lifelong tags on the cells of their skin, hair, nails, eyes, teeth, sinuses, and nervous system."**

**"The eSyrup 'infects' these cells, [hijacking the existing cellular machinery to modify the cells' membranes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane#Composition) and grant the person a 'intradermal shield'."**

### Page 2

**"This intradermal shield allows the Automata to exist above ground, and fulfill the prime directive of their clan -- to restore the Amazon Rainforest."**

We see close-up views of the people in the inner most circle, just on the outside of the metal hoop:  

* Jina, also covered in clan tatoos and splendid eSyrup ritual clothing. Jina's intradermal shield is visible in shadowy patterns under her clan tatoos. Next to her is a tall bucket holding ritual clensing water.  
* Amadou, no intradermal shield and just a few clan tatoos, but dressed spledidly and unspeakably proud of his daughter.   
* Majhee, matriarch leader of their clan, intradermal shield barely visible beneath the many clan tatoos. She is proud, stern, and exhuberant on this day of achievement by her granddaughter.  
* Maraba, Min's cousin and dearest childhood companion, now an Expert Inker and chosen for the honour of injecting Min's intradermal shield. Next to Maraba, in a shallow curving woven basket, is an enormous syringe full of swirling, bubbling, raw eSyrup, freshly harvested from one of their original, surviving cultures, called "Mothers". 

**"DOOOOHM!"** 

The drums all come to a halt, and all of the concentric circles except the innermost lean in sharply on that last booming beat, hands all stretched towards Min, fingers shaking. 

Jina, Majhee, Amadou, and Maraba stand up and pick up the metal hoop. They hold it in place as Min steps onto the curving metal, hands pushing against the hoop above her head. Then they strap Min's ankles and wrists to the metal hoop. 

### Page 3

Maraba picks up the syringe as Jina picks up the bucket of water, leaving Majhee and Amadou to hold the hoop with Min inside steady. 

Jina pours the bucket of water slowly over Min until Min is drenched, then returns the bucket to its previous location in the circle. Then Maraba positions the needle of the syringe full of raw eSyrup against Min's right buttcheek, breaks the skin, and slowly injects all of the eSyrup as Min grits her teeth. 

Min's cousin pulls out the syringe and places it back on the basket. Then Jina, Amadou, Majhee, and Maraba turn Min in slow circles as the raw eSyrup spreads throughout her body, spreading up her torso, across her arms and legs, over her face, and into her eyelids. As the intradermal shield continues into her mouth, nose, and sinuses, Min begins to cough and gag. 

Min's body convulses as her inner circle sets her upright in the very center again. 

The crowd chants **"Seja livre! Seja LIVRE! SEJA LIVRE!"** as Min finishes integrating the intradermal shield. 

*translation: "Be free! Be FREE! BE FREE!"*

After a tense moment, Min focuses her intradermal awareness to sprout razor sharp spikes at her wrists and ankles, cutting her bonds. The crowd roars with triumph. 

Majhee: **"Minka Oosou, filha de Jina e Amadou, surfista de árvore para os Autômatos!"**

*translation: "Minka Oosou, daughter of Jina and Amadou, Tree Surfer of the Automata!"*

View of Min from the front, gasping, blinking away large beads of sweat from her eyes as she looks up at her grandmother.  

Majhee's eyes, proud, confident, expectant: **"O QUE SIGNIFICA SER LIVRE?"**

*translation: "WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE FREE?"*

Min closes her eyes, tries to calm her breathing, and struggles to stand. 

Min: **"Beber sem sangrar, respirar sem engasgar, ver o céu e saudar o dia em minha própria pele..."**

*translation: "To drink without bleeding, to breathe without choking, to see the sky and greet the day in my own skin..."*

Min: **"...e MOVER em qualquer direção com curiosidade e graça..."**

*translation: "...and to MOVE in any direction with curiosity and grace..."*

Zoom in on Min's mouth, exhausted yet serene, confident, and defiant.

Min: **"...mesmo FORA DO PLANETA!"**

*translation: "...even OFF THE PLANET!"*

### Chapter Title Page

Min, Asoka, and Iri are in a tall tree, watching the Peacekeepers set up camp as the sky lightens. Min is standing out in the middle of a large branch and grips a smaller branch with so much fury that it breaks in her hand. Face streaming in tears, heart full of rage, she screams as she flings the broken stick in her hand down at the soldiers with all her might, growing spikes in her feet to keep herself locked to the tree branch, but the Peacekeepers have caused so much damage to the surrounding forest that no one notices that yet another broken branch falling violently onto their campsite; and the sounds of their generators drown out her furious cries. Asoka, head gear properly back on and once again fully camouflaged, clings fearfully to the main trunk of the tree, watching Asoka with wide eyes -- they see a beast, and they are afraid. Iri, also camouflaged, clings to Asoka's neck. 

### Page 1

In a quieter, more mature part of the re-grown forest, Min, dead-eyed and haggard after screaming herself hoarse at the Peacekeeper camp, sits across from Asoka, on the outer edge of a branch, leaning into the tree and letting spikes in her back lock her in. She stares grudgingly at Asoka in the early morning light. 

Min: **"Entou, estranho, por que você traz esses bárbaros para minha floresta?"**

*translation: "So, stranger, why do you bring these barbarians to my forest?"*

Asoka's veil is back on, and the anonymous face embroidered onto it is earnest, pleading. 

Asoka: **"*I didn't bring them! I mean...*"**

Iri once again places 2 arms on Asoka's ears. 

Asoka: **"*Eu não trouxe eles. Eu vim para avisá-lo!*"**

*translation: "I didn't bring them. I came to warn you!"* 

Min: **"E por que você faria isso?"**

*translation: "And why would you do that?"*

Suddenly, Asoka's face also falls dark. 

Asoka, off-panel: **"*O World Government tem estado atrás dos Green Havens há anos ... no começo eles queriam 30% de nossa safra anual. Nós nos recusamos. Então, alguns anos depois, bandos itinerantes de animais enormes e demoníacos começaram a aparecer no Norte. Eles eram enormes e impossivelmente rápidos e mataram todos em um Green Haven em questão de minutos...*"**

*translation: "The World Government has been after the Green Havens for years...at first they wanted 30% of our yearly crop. We refused. Then, a few years later, roaming bands of enormous, demonic beasts began appearing in the North. They were huge and impossibly fast and killed everyone in a Green Haven in a matter of minutes.."*

### Page 2

Asoka's fists clench. We see Asoka's eyes from behind their face veil, angry tears streaming down their face. 

Asoka: **"*O Alto Conselho de Biononimous acredita que as Bestas foram criadas pelo World Government para fornecer a elas uma desculpa conveniente para colocar os Pacificadores em cada Green Haven ... agora, há pelo menos 40 Pacificadores em cada Haven, e eles estão *forçosamente* tomando 50% da nossa comida!*"**

*translation: "The Biononymous High Council believes that the Beasts were created by the World Government in order to provide them with a convenient excuse to station Peacekeepers in every Green Haven...now, there are at least 40 Peacekeepers at each Haven, and they're **forcibly** taking 50% of our food!"*

The scene has transitioned to the Central Hearth of the Automata, an enormous tree-house structure with an eSyrup-bubble ceiling. The sun above is not quite at its zenith. Min and Asoka stand before a crowd of Automata, both children and Elders, members of the Automata clan who have all received their intradermal shield and successfully returned to the Amazon forest after spending at least a year living in the Underground Cities to the south of the Red Zone. Asoka is kneeling and facing the gathered crowd of Automata with desperate supplication, as Iri sits on Asoka's shoulders, arms wrapped around Asoka's head and neck. Children openly stare at Iri and Asoka's strange clothing. Elders look troubled or angry, or both.

Min addresses Nova Jatobá, currently serving as Head Councilor of Elders, around whom the curious crowd has gathered. 

Min: **"Eu vi esses Pacificadores, com meus próprios olhos. Eles não sabem, ou *não se importam*, que sua busca por 'frutas exóticas' e humanos mágicos está destruindo a floresta que é muito *delicada* para essa *merda*!"**

*translation: "I saw these Peacekeepers, with my own eyes. They don't know, or **don't care**, that their search for 'exotic fruits' and magical humans is destroying a forest that is too **delicate** for this shit!"*

### Page 3

Nova gives Min a sharp look. Nova is now in her 70s, still plump but now strengthened by decades of living in the rainforest. 

Nova: **"Tsk! *Min*ka, tenha cuidado..."**

*translation: "Tsk! **Min**ka, you watch yourself..."*

Min stubbornly glares back at Nova. 

Min: **"Eu solicito um conselho pelos Anciãos, para considerar esta aliança com os Biononymous!"**

*translation: "I request a Council of the Elders, to consider this alliance with the Biononymous!"*

Nova raises an eyebrow. 

Nova: **"Embora não tenhamos motivos para amar os Peacekeepers, por que nos aliamos a um povo muito longe para ver, ouvir ou tocar?"**

*translation: "While we have no reason to love the Peacekeepers, why would we ally ourselves to a people too far away to see, hear, or touch?"*

Min, furious, gets right in Nova's stony, unmoved face. 

Min: **"Entou, você não se importa com eles?? Eles também são Earthers!"**

*translation: "So, you don't care about them?? They're also Earthers!"*

Off-panel: **"Aiii, Minkinha, quando você vai aprender *um pouco de paciência*?"**

*translation: "Aiii, little Minka, when will you learn **a little bit of patience**?"*

### Page 4

Majhee Suh, soon to be in her 90s, pushes her way through the crowd to the front. She is tiny, wrinkled, and no longer able to climb trees, but her back is still straight, and she eyes her granddaughter with laser-beam eyes. Min sheepishly withdraws and looks down, scowling. 

Majhee sighs. 

Majhee: **"Infelizmente, eu concordo com a minha neta. Eu estava preocupado que esse dia chegasse...mas, primeiro nós comemos!"**

*translation: "Unfortunately, I agree with my granddaughter. I was worried that this day would come...but, first we eat!"*

Majhee grins and her eyes twinkle. 

Majhee: **"Ninguém pode pensar com o estômago vazio!"**

*translation: "No one can think with an empty stomach!"*

### Page 5

Asoka, Iri still tucked into their neck, has been seated next to Min on floor mats in front of a low table piled high with more food than Asoka has seen in weeks. It's midday, and bright natural light floods the Central Hearth, but the temperature is comfortable. Overhead, an enormous eSyrup bubble protects the Central Hearth from the harsh sun and poisonous air, like a giant cell membrane. The day's cooking crew has just brought out the last of the serving plates, piled high with steaming hot food that makes Asoka's salivation response go wild. Asoka's face veil annotates the many strange fishes, vegetables, fruit, and grain laid out in lavish display. We see Nicola Cavalcanti, now a robust and cheeky grandmother in her 50s, carrying out the last trays of [escabeche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escabeche) made with [tambaqui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tambaqui), and behind her, another elder, [one of the few men with white hair and wrinkles](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/jan/29/men-cancer-deaths-greater-women), carries out large bowls full of [kkakdugi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kkakdugi). 

As the last serving bowl is placed on the tables, a hush falls over the entire room. Asoka, eager to start eating, looks around in confusion, then hesitantly starts to reach for a bowl of rice. Min slaps down Asoka's hand. 

Min: **"Ainda não!"**

*translation: "Not yet!"*

### Page 6

A large gong rings. Asoka looks up towards one end of the Central Hearth to see 2 lines of Automata Elders, each carrying an enormous pitcher in one arm and a large bowl with a pouring edge in the other; one shoulder covered in a long, folded piece of beautiful pale blue cloth of the finest weave; and converging on a large spigot coming out of an enormous stone aquifer.  

Asoka: *"That whole wall..."*

Iri: *"The rock is **cold**!"*

Asoka's face veil annotates the temperature of the aquifer's enormous rock wall to be 7.2 deg celsius. 

The water cyclers ceremoniously place the pitchers in front of them and gently place the folded blue eSyrup cloth on top of the pitcher, as the entire Central Hearth watch them. They then take turns walking up to the great stone wall and filling their bowl in the rapidly flowing and high pressure water from the spigot. They then walk back to their pitchers and place the bowl next to the pitcher. Kneeling in front of their pitcher, each Elder swiftly and skillfully folds their blue cloth into an [origami flower bowl](http://www.origami-instructions.com/origami-rose-bowl.html), then secures it to the top of the enormous pitcher. They then stand and pour the bowl of water carefully into the eSyrup cloth flower bowl, which filters and cleans the water as it passes through the bottom layer of cloth. 

Over the above sequence of images is the following dialogue: 

Asoka: **"*Quem são eles?*"**

*translation: "Who are they?"*

Min watches one Water Cycler in particular - her mother Jina, daughter of Majhee Suh and Vec Barbosa -- with proud reverence.

Min: **"Eles são os *cicladores de água*."**

*translation: "They are the **water cyclers**."*

Asoka: **"*Os cicladores de água?*"**

*translation: "The water cyclers?"*

### Page 7

Min: **"Todos os dias eles [tratam a água](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_purification#Treatment) coletamos da chuva, do rio e de [nosso esgoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reclaimed_water)."**

*translation: "Every day, they [treat the water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_purification#Treatment) we collect from the rain, from the river, and from [our sewage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reclaimed_water)."*

Asoka: **"*Espere, o que??*"**

*translation: "Wait, what??"*

Min: **"Você não ouviu? Nós tivemos uma crise da água. Você teve a sorte de estar perto de nascentes de montanha e terras que não foram brutalmente abusadas. É diferente aqui."**

*translation: "Didn't you hear? We had a Water Crisis. You were lucky enough to be near mountain springs and land that hadn't been brutally abused. It's different here."*

The Water Cyclers have all poured their bowls of water into the enormous pitchers. They detach the origami flower bowl from the pitcher and in one confident, practiced shake, release the cloth from its shape. They then fold the cloth neatly and place it back on one shoulder. They then each carry their pitcher to a table, where they place it carefully. They then get a cup, pour themselves a glass, and raise it up.

Water Cyclers: **"Beber sem sangrar!"**

*translation: "Drink without bleeding!"*

The Water Cyclers then all down their glass, the first cup of the water they offer to their clanmates. As they finish, the gathered Automata start to clap and cheer and eat and drink. Min grins and reaches for the escabeche. 

Min: **"Certo, *agora* podemos comer."**

*translation: "Ok, **now** we can eat."*

### Page 8

Nova: **"Entou...'Pacificadores de Governo Mundial'...um nome mais irônico..."**

*translation: "So...'World Government Peacekeepers'...a most ironic name..."*

Nova is sitting across from Asoka and Iri. Her eyes, the faintest of crow's feet at their edges, stare thoughtfully at Asoka and Iri as she takes a big bite of [pirarucu steak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arapaima). Next to Nova sits Majhee Suh, who still eats everything with metal chopsticks. Majhee waves to the old man who was carrying kkakdugi earlier, who is now sitting a little ways down the table and across from Nicola. 

Nova: **"Oi, Osiel! Passe o kkakdugi aqui!"**

*translation: "Oi, Osiel! Pass the kkakdugi over here!"*

Majhee: **"Nova, fomos fluentes em inglês uma vez...let's speak in this little one's native tongue, and give our [babelfish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babel_fish) some practice."**

*translation: "Nova, we were fluent in english once...vamos falar na língua nativa deste pequenino, e dar nosso [babelfish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babel_fish) alguns prática."*

All throughout the Central Hearth, conversation buzzes with discussion, debate, and speculation over Asoka's news of the World Government Peacekeepers and the offer of alliance from the Biononymous. Asoka eagerly eats everything within reach. 

### Page 9

Nova: **"Very well."**

Nova begins to eat her escabeche, rice, and kkakdugi with delicate precision. Majhee fiendishly wields her chopsticks while wrapping [roasted and salted bijao leaves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliconia_bihai) around sticky brown rice and [wild rice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice#Caribbean_and_Latin_America) and various side dishes. Majhee wraps her most recent [modified gimbap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimbap), including the radish stems in the kkakdugi, stir-fried spinach, and fried slices of plantain distributed in serving bowls around all of the tables throughout the Central Hearth. 

Majhee: **"Well, this is *exciting*!"**

Osiel looks up from opening up the [juane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juane) on his plate and shoots Majhee an annoyed look.

Osiel: **"Don't be so cheerful. It's happened! Space Consortium is back! So what do we do now??"**

The elder turns a skeptical eye onto Asoka. 

Osiel: **"And how do we know that *you* aren't a spy? Your veil makes me nervous!"**

Majhee: **"Oh, calm down Osiel. No matter what they're wearing, they're a human child, far from home and *obviously* hungry."**

Murmurs of sympathetic agreement rise from nearby Elders. Osiel grumpily focuses on his juane and looks only a little less troubled. Asoka focuses on how delicious they are finding fried plantains to be. 

### Page 11

Maraba, sitting across the table from Min, swallows a bite of [pirarucu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arapaima) [à_Gomes_de_Sá](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacalhau_à_Gomes_de_Sá) and turns to Min and Asoka. 

Maraba: **"*I* think we can safely assume that eventually, the WORLD GOV *will* find us, given that they're in orbit, and they've already seen enough of us to send one warship. So we might as well take action now, and join our strength with the Biononymous!"**

Min: **"And the Peacekeeper's actions have proven their ignorant and evil intentions! We should fight to defend what we've worked so hard to regain!!"**

Osiel, looking bored, sighs. 

Osiel: **"You fresh Elders...always wanna go beat up *someone*, just because you finally have a intradermal shield!"**

Osiel shakes his head, then points accusingly at Min.

Osiel: **"*You* haven't even gone off to your year Underground!"**

### Page 12

Min scowls again. Nicola kicks Osiel under the table and gives him a withering look. 

Nicola: **"Stop being such a grumpy old man!"**

Nova, who has been listening and watching the many conversations around her, sighs. 

Nova: **"The [consensus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making#Quaker-based_model) may be difficult to find..."**

Asoka: **"*Consensus?*"**

Nova glances up at Asoka, still not used to the synthetic voice coming from Asoka's face veil, then she gives a gentle smile. 

Nova: **"When the Council of the Elders make a group decision, we all share our concerns until our group goal is clear to everyone. As we all work towards a group decision, if an Elder's perspective doesn't fit into the group decision, the Elder can choose to 'stand aside' or 'block' the emerging consensus."**

Nova's brow furrows. 

Nova: **"But if even one Elder chooses to 'block' an action, we have to find another direction in which we can form consensus. (Sigh!) It's gonna be tricky!"**

## Chapter 7: Mistakes Are How We Evolve

Character designs: Asoka Morei, Iri, Minka Oosou, Majhee Suh, Nova Jatobá, Jina Suh Barbosa, Maraba Barbosa Jatobá

### Page 1

The late morning sun filters into Asoka's sleeping bubble, a private eSyrup structure suspended in a tree just above the Automata Central Hearth. Asoka's red hair, splayed out on the pillow in their eSyrup hammock, glistens in the bright light. Iri is splayed out on top of Asoka's chest, snoring peacefully. Asoka's jacket, head scarf, and face veil hang on the tree trunk next to one of the hammock's anchor points. On the massive tree branch extending out underneath Asoka's hammock, Asoka's boots and socks are neatly placed, just underneath the jacket and head gear. Asoka's gloves are tucked into the jacket pockets, fabric fingers curling over the edge of the pocket openings. On another hook on the main trunk, on the other side of Asoka's hammock anchor, is a cloth water canteen. A spiral staircase is carved into the main trunk, leading in one direction down to the Central Hearth, and in the other, all the way to the top of the tall canopy tree. 

Asoka eyes are open, and they stare emotionlessly at the fractal patterns of tree branches above their hammock, dappled light softened by the filtration of their sleeping bubble and the various other sleeping bubbles suspended in the tree above theirs. Shadows show hammocks and various belongings in the other sleeping bubbles, but at the moment, all of the other sleeping bubbles are empty of people. Asoka hears a muffled voice call through their eSyrup bubble. 

Min: **"Asoka?"**

Asoka doesn't move. 

Min: **"Asoka, to entrando!"**

*translation: "Asoka, I'm coming in!"*

Min steps through the bubble membrane. She looks calmer than when we last saw her, though not as dejected as Asoka. Iri discreetly places their arms over Asoka's ears and turns their head towards Min obligingly. 

Min: **"Almoço?"**

*translation: "Lunch?"*

Asoka doesn't move or answer. Iri chirps worriedly at Asoka, then looks at Min apologetically. 

Iri: **"Talvez...não hoje..."**

*translation: "Maybe...not today..."*

Min: **"Não seja ridículo. Pulou ontem também."**

*translation: "Don't be ridiculous. You skipped yesterday also."*

Asoka still doesn't answer. Min attempts to be funny. 

Min: **"Eu também não estou feliz sobre o decisão de Anciãos, mas não deixe que seus peidos matem seu apetite."**

*translation: "I'm not happy about the Elders' decision either, but don't let their farts kill your appetite."*

No response from Asoka. Min loses her patience. 

Min: **"Nesse caso, passar fome! Descubra o que é bom para quem!"**

*translation: "In that case, starve yourself! Discover what good that does for anyone!"*

Min grits her teeth, gives Asoka an angry look over her shoulder, and huffily exits the bubble. 

### Page 2

**"32 hours earlier..."**

Nova: **"It seems our consensus is building towards rejecting the alliance with the Biononymous, and moving our re-forestation efforts away from Manaus and [Gruta de Judeia](https://goo.gl/maps/v8ocpUS8njq). I'd like to hear from any Elders whose feelings remain incompatible with this decision."**

The sun is setting in the sky, and everyone looks exhausted. The gathered crowd ranges from babes-in-arms to silver haired grandmothers, but the Elders are clustered towards the center. Most of the Elders look relieved that the consensus has ended up the way it did. A few, including Majhee, show neutral or otherwise expressionless faces. Maraba gives Min, whose face is one of angry, tearful resignation, a distraught look before speaking. 

Maraba: **"I stand aside."**

A wave of relief moves through the gathered Automata. Nova nods, clearly eager to wrap things up. 

Nova: **"Concerning the fate of our visitor, Asoka Morei, our consensus seems to be building towards letting them stay with us for as long as they wish, under the condition that they will remain a child in the eyes of the Automata -- Asoka will never be eligible to receive a intradermal shield, nor to block a consensus of the Elders. Are there any Elders whose feelings remain incompatible with this decision?"**

The gathered Elders are all silent. 

Nova: **"Very well, we have reached consensus. Thank you everyone for your time."**

With a cry of rage, Min runs to the edge of the Central Hearth platform and leaps to the next tree. Maraba runs after her. 

Maraba: **"Min!"**

Jina, looking upset, also starts to move after Min, but the tall, dark man next to her, with very few clan tatoos and no intradermal shield, places a hand on Jina's leg and gently shakes his head. Jina sits back down, and she and the man hug. Over Jina's head, the man stares after Min, who is leaping from tree to tree, trying to work off her anger and disappointment. 

### Page 3

It's late afternoon. Asoka is sitting up in their hammock and drinking from the cloth water canteen that had been hanging by their hammock. Asoka is so weak that Iri must help hold up the canteen, which is getting empty. 

Iri: *"You'll have to get out of bed, at least for more water...you keep crying away all of your moisture..."*

Asoka: *"What's the point? I came all this way, and I failed. It was a mistake to leave Green Haven Clarksville..."*

Asoka starts to cry. Their stomach rumbles loudly, pityingly, and Iri looks worried. 

Iri: *"Soka, pleeeaaase will you eat something? Maybe there's leftovers at the Central Hearth..."*

They both look up at the sound of a scratch on Asoka's sleeping bubble. Asoka and Iri exchange a glance, then Asoka sighs and ties back their hair. 

Asoka: *"Fine, I'll get up."*

Asoka swings their legs out of the hammock, rubbing their face with one hand. Iri hands Asoka their head scarf, face veil, and jacket while yelling in the direction of the inquisitive scratch. 

Iri: **"Um momento!"**

*translation: "Just a minute!"*

### Page 4

We see a view from above, of Asoka and Min sitting across from each other on the large tree trunk beneath Asoka's hammock. Asoka is wearing their head scarf, but the face veil is pulled back, revealing their face so that they can eat. Asoka's jacket is on but un-fastened up the front. Between the two teens is a large, mouth-watering [dosirak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dosirak) of leftovers from the Central Hearth, sitting on top of the [bojagi](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bojagi) that Min had used to bring it up to Asoka's bubble. Asoka eats ravenously as Min pours from a tall thermos of sweet juice made from [Ungurahua](https://youtu.be/baWFekERwsw) fruit into two wooden cups. Min puts down the thermos and watches Asoka eat with satisfaction. Iri peers curiously into the thermos. Min, looking a bit abashed, offers her cup to the mechapet. 

Min: **"Desculpa...você quer tentar?"**

*translation: "Sorry...wanna try?"*

Iri: **"Certo!"**

*translation: "Sure!"*

Iri carefully tips a small amount of liquid into its mouth. Its eyes light up -- Iri likes the juice a lot! Iri downs the rest of the glass. 

Iri: **"Mmmmmm!!"**

Min: **"É suco, feito com [fruta de patua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oenocarpus_bataua)."**

*translation: "It's juice, made with [patua fruit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oenocarpus_bataua)."*

Iri, looking like an adorable, cuttlefish version of Oliver Twist, endearingly holds out the wooden cup to Min. 

Iri: **"Por favor, mais?"**

*translation: "Please, more?"*

Min can't help laughing at how cute Iri is, and pats Iri on the head. 

Min: **"Claro!"**

*translation: "Of course!"*

### Page 5

Asoka looks up at Iri from their dosirak, eyes moody and accusing. 

Asoka: **"*You know, I can't understand anything when you don't translate for me...*"**

Iri deflates completely and droops with guilt. 

Min: **"Ah, sorry! I'm just not used to using my babelfish."**

Asoka accepts by shrugging and wordlessly digging back into the food. Min and Iri exchange awkward glances. 

Min: **"I was telling Iri, this is juice made from patua...we have a big grove nearby, I can show you how to harvest them!"**

Asoka doesn't look up from eating. 

Asoka: **"*Whatever.*"**

Min is hurt by the total lack of enthusiasm from Asoka. She loses her patience again. 

Min: **"What, do you plan to spend the rest of your life moping inside your sleeping bubble, hoping people will feel sorry enough for you to bring you food? I didn't have to bring you leftovers, this isn't my assignment or anything!"**

Asoka: **"*Why do you care?*"**

Min: **"Why do you *not* care? Don't you realise that by giving up, you're letting the Peacekeepers and the WORLD GOV *win*??"**

### Page 6

Asoka starts to get upset. 

Asoka: **"*They already won...my home is gone, and my family is dead!*"**

Min: **"What about your people, the other Biononymous? Didn't you come all this way to help them??"**

Asoka: **"*Yeah, exactly! I tried, and I failed...*"**

In her frustration, Min gets up on her knees, trying to tower over Asoka, who even when sitting is at least a good head taller. 

Min: **"So are you gonna sit there and continue to be useless, just because *one thing* didn't turn out *exactly* the way you expected??"**

Asoka: **"Useless...yes, that's exactly what I am..."**

Asoka begins crying again, and hides their face in their hands. Min looks upset that she triggered Asoka's tears, but she is also still angry with Asoka's apathy. Iri crawls into Asoka's lap and strokes Asoka's hands with its arms. 

Min: **"Look, I'm so sorry...I get really impatient sometimes...I'm just...*so angry* about the Peacekeepers..."**

Min crawls around the food to kneel by Asoka. 

Min: **"...can I give you hug?"**

Asoka doesn't look up, but gives a tiny nod. 

Asoka, barely audible: **"*Yes...*"**

Iri gives Min an encouraging smile and moves to Asoka's shoulder. Min embraces Asoka gently, tentatively. Asoka turns their face into Min's chest and begins to cry loudly, in heaving sobs. Min's eyes start to also fill with tears, and the two teens cry and hold each other. Iri's arms gently cradle both of their heads. 

### Page 7

Asoka and Min sit in the upper branches of Asoka's sleeping bubble, backs against the main tree trunk, watching the sun disappear behind the horizon. Early stars and fireflies are already twinkling in the twilight, and a waning moon is rising. Both teens are sipping patua fruit juice, faces streaked with tears and looking emotionally spent. Iri is cozily curled around Asoka's shoulders. 

Asoka: **"This juice is *so* good!"**

Min: **"Mmmhmm! Amadou, my gene father, makes the *best* patua juice!"**

Asoka: **"Is Amadou also a Water Cycler?"**

Min: **"No...actually, he's kind of like you..."**

Min: **"When Jina, my gene mother, left for her Year Underground, she traveled far south to Artigas, an Underground City in a country onced called Uruguay. She met Amadou while they were both doing some temprorary work in an [amethyst mine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amethyst#Geographic_distribution). Amadou was obsessed with explosives and rockets, and more than anything else, he wanted to become an eSyrup fusion technician, and explore the galaxy on an Ursu-class research vessel."**

### Page 8

During the dialogue on pages 8-10, we see younger versions of Jina and Amadou, the tall dark man who hugged her after the Elders decided to reject the Biononymous' offer of alliance, as Min tells the story of how Amadou came to the Automata. 

**"2096: Underground mining community of Artigas, Uruguay"**

Amadou: **"Jina, look!"**

Amadou and Jina are still dressed in their work uniforms, filthy with mining dust and eating cave rations from the WORLD GOV. They are sitting on a bench in a grubby underground 'park' in the Underground City of Artigas, a glorified open space lined with tough hedges and sad-looking, stunted trees. The artificial lights overhead flicker, and the walls shine with traces of amethyst, hinting at the enormous vein of violet quartz that kept Artigas on the map. Though amethyst was once valued primarily for its usage in jewelry, these days, it is more often mined to feed industrial eSyrup cultures. 

Amadou is pointing to a large public INFO-SPHERE at one end of the 'park', which announces that Heiko Gabriel Oesterheld, an eminent eSyrup combustion engineer, has just accepted a post at the Caverno Ouro Grosso Launch Station, where he will be updating the Launch Station's fleet of Space Barges. Amadou watches the INFO-SPHERE news feed with starry eyes. 

Amadou: **"The great [HGO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Héctor_Germán_Oesterheld)...I'll travel to Ouro Grosso and become his apprentice, no matter what it takes!"**

Off-panel: **"*Amadou*??"**

Amadou turns, and his jaw drops in shock.

Amadou: **"Otto?? So good to see you! Wait...what *happened* to you??"**

We see Otto, a thin, frightened man with ragged clothing and dark circles under his eyes. 

Min: **"Otto and Amadou had grown up in the same tiny, remote cave in the [Sierras de Córdoba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierras_de_Córdoba) called Cueva De Los Pajaritos. Amadou had always spoken very fondly of his home, but in the 2 years since Amadou had left, a violent and unstable man named Bautista [de Rosas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Manuel_de_Rosas) killed the governor, declared himself the 'righteous ruler', and started enforcing all kinds of 'austerity laws' and outrageous taxes."**

Min: **"When the WORLD GOV showed up a few months later, they completely ignored Bautista's horrifying abuse of power. Instead, they offered Bautista extra food rations in exchange for every able-bodied adult he sent to work on 'space construction projects crucial to developing the next phase of humanity'. Bautista forcibly signed up 30 males over 18 who had ever expressed dissatisfaction with Bautista's rule, including Otto and his sickly, aging father. Amadou's father, being one of the cave's HVAC engineers, was among those considered too valuable to be sent away in the work draft."**

### Page 9

Otto, Amadou, and Jina are now inside a residential barracks, where Amadou is trying to get Otto to eat some hot soup. 

Otto: **"Conditions were so bad, my father died within a week of getting into orbit. It took me another 6 months to escape, but I did it..."**

Min: **"Otto stowed away on a Space Barge in order to get back to planetside, a criminal offense that could get him jailed for up to a year."**

Otto: **"I've been trying to get back to the Sierras de Córdoba for the last 2 months...and on the way, I keep seeing people from our cave in the work draft caravans on their way to Ouro Grosso..."**

Otto stands, fired up with fury.

Otto: **"I swear, I'll kill Bautista de Rosas for what he's done!!"**

Otto then faints. 

Min: **"Amadou and Jina nursed Otto back to health, then they both insisted on traveling with him. When they made it back to Cueva De Los Pajaritos, it was even worse than Otto had described. Bautista had basically enslaved the entire remaining population to serve his brutish desires. He and his cronies were eating lavishly and forcibly taking whatever they wanted without consequence, while the rest of cave starved or fell ill from working the surface farms without sufficient protective gear."**

### Page 10

Min: **"Otto, Amadou, and Jina were able to organize an uprising against Bautista, but their victory came at a terrible cost. Many died, including Otto and Amadou's parents, and when Bautista's men realised they were losing the battle, they started burning homes. In the end, Amadou beheaded Bautista in one-on-one combat, and Bautista's remaining supporters were driven out of the cave to die in the surrounding mountains."**

Min: **"The people of Cueva De Los Pajaritos were freed from the tyrant, but Amadou felt like a complete failure. His parents and so many of his friends were dead, and now that he had killed an officer of the WORLD GOV, he was a wanted criminal with a bounty on his head. He would never get anywhere near a Launch Station ever again, and he would never become a space explorer."** 

Min: **"Worried that his presence might cause trouble for the other villagers, Amadou let Jina convince him to travel with her back to the Automata. The Elders let him stay under the same conditions they granted you -- as an eternal child, without an interdermal shield and without the right to block consensus. But he didn't let that stop him from living as intensely as he had back in the Underground Cities."**

### Page 11

We're back in 2116. Min and Asoka are climbing the spiral staircase to the top of the canopy. Asoka is fully dressed, and Iri sits on top of their head. 

Min: **"The Automata raise all of their children together, but even if Amadou wasn't my gene father he would still be my favorite. Ever since I can remember, Amadou taught us how to identify stars and planets in the night sky; to play with pyrotechnics without losing a finger or an eye; and he even improved our eSyrup bubbles so that he could take the little ones on field trips into the forest. He was always telling us stories from the past and his crazy dreams for the future."**

They've reached a small, swaying tree platform at the top of the tree. Min, Asoka, and Iri are looking out over a vast rainforest canopy. The tree platform is encased in the thinnest of eSyrup bubbles, barely visible and reproducing the outer wind conditions so perfectly that for a moment, Asoka is afraid to breathe. Above both teens is the night sky, resplendent with stars and the un-twinkling lights of planets and Orbiter vessels.

Asoka: **"*Woooooooow...!*"**

Min let's Asoka and Iri take in the breathtaking view, eyes glistening with pride as she surveys the reforestation efforts of the Automata. Min is standing, spikes on her feet keeping her anchored to the tree platform, while Asoka, less comfortable in the canopy, kneels and cluthes nearby branches with their hands. 

Min: **"I used to wonder why Amadou kept being so obsessed with the Orbiters -- hadn't they hurt him enough? Wasn't re-growing the Amazon Rainforest a big enough dream? "**

### Page 12

Min: **"But...'to be autonomous is to be able to make *informed* and *un-coerced* decisions' -- that's the fundamental belief of the Automata. In *this* world, we'll never be fully informed or un-coerced if we don't understand the Orbiters...if we don't understand what it's like to be up *there*. So I'm going to spend my Year Underground building up a fake Universal Record, then apply to the ISE Corps!"**

Asoka: **"*The ISE Corps?*"**

Min: **"The International Space Exploration Corps. It's a school, usually only for Orbiters...but a few years ago they announced a 'Space Asylum Program', a scholarship for Earthers interested in space exploration! I'll make it into that program, no matter what it takes!"** 

Min grins widely and reaches up with both arms, intradermal shield activated, to let her hands push out past the eSyrup bubble and feel the real east wind. Min laughs with delight. 

Asoka: **"*Understand the Orbiters...do you really think you can do that?*"**

Min turns to Asoka with a look of ferocious, gleeful determination. 

Min: **"Only one way to find out, is there?"**

Asoka stares at Min, open-mouthed. 

Asoka: **"*But...what if you fail?*"**

Min kneels in front of Asoka and looks at them with intense earnestness. 

Min: **"Your parents and grandparents must have failed many times before they could make an eSyrup textile as powerful as yours -- *it even kept you alive in the Red Zone*. Is there really *nothing* you want to do with the freedom they gave you?"**

## Dream, the last: Comma, not a Period

### Page 1

The Automata have gathered to say goodbye to Min. Today, she leaves for her Year Underground. Min is dressed in lightweight travel gear and has a substantial pack strapped to her back. Pinned to Min's clothing and pack are flowers, leaves, tiny delicate knotwork for good fortune, and other small trinkets of affection and remembrance. Maraba adjusts a good luck knot in Min's hair and gives Min a huge, albeit teary, grin. Amadou kneels to be face to face with his rather short daughter. His eyes are full of tears, and he opens his mouth to speak, but then finds that he cannot. Instead, he pulls Min into a huge bear hug. Father and daughter embrace fiercely. Amadou kisses Min on the forehead, then stands as Min turns to hug Jina, just as fiercely. Min then tenderly hugs Majhee, who chuckles and shoos Min along the line of well-wishers.

### Page 2

Asoka stands towards the end of the line, trying to look happy but unable to hide their deep, cutting sadness. They keep their eyes down as Min approaches them; Asoka is the last to say goodbye. Asoka holds out in one hand the tiny origami dragon folded from a delicate piece of eSyrup cloth that they made as their parting gift. With the other hand, they stroke the dragon's spine -- it yawns and stretches, like a tiny folded lizard-cat made of living cloth. Min's eyes widen with delight - she's never seen such a tiny, delicate origami dragon before. 

Min reverently places the little origami dragon her shoulder, where it circles a few times then settles onto its haunches, fluttering its wings a bit with pleasure at its new vantage point. 

Min looks up at the crying Asoka, who is trying hard to smile through their tears. Min grins. 

Min: **"Don't you dare slack on your capoeira training, just because I'm gone!"**

Asoka and Min clasp hands as Asoka returns Min's grin, matching her fierceness with their own.

Asoka: **"*You watch out! I'll train so hard, in 2 years I'll definitely be able to beat you!*"**

Min throws back her head in a full-throated laugh.

Min: **"Deal! Until we meet again, in orbit!"**
