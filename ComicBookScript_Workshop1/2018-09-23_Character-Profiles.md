### What does this character want?

Majhee has always wanted to discover a way to directly interface biological tissue with digital computing circuits, in order to build better medical devices that would integrate with the body's anatomy and physiology. When she got the 10-year research and development grant from the UN, her whole focus was on developing better, less expensive air and water filters for the "Global South", and she hardly paid attention to the fact that Space Consortium was patenting bespoke technological applications of eSyrup. However, after the Space Consortium demanded to be able to patent eSyrup fuel even though it was a basic research finding and not a custom commercial application, then sues the shit out of Majhee's research institute in order to gain exclusive IP ownership, Majhee becomes obsessed with publishing as many eSyrup applications into the public domain as fast as possible to prevent Space Consortium from patenting any more basic eSyrup research and gaining a monopoly on knowledge and tech crucial to daily life and public health. 

When the Global Water Crisis hits, Majhee decides to relocate further inland, to the edge of the Amazon Rainforest, bringing with her anyone from her research group and her community back in São Paulo who wishes to join her. There, she focuses on developing a way to splice eSyrup into the human body so that humans can freely move about on the planet's surface again, protected against the sun's radiations; the overload of nitrogen dioxide, carbon dioxide, and other toxic gases in the atmosphere; and surface water, which is now both hyper-salinated and often contaminated with toxic acids. 

## Kai Oliveira

Born in São Paulo, Kai's parents immigrated from Japan to Brazil a year before Kai was born. Kai graduated from Unicamp ([Universidade Estadual de Campinas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Campinas)) with a bachelor's degree in organic chemistry and a master's degree in materials science before going to Seoul, Korea to pursue a PhD in "bio-silicate interfaces". There she met a young and ambitious Majhee, who convinced Kai that academic researchers need to take a more active stance on how their research is applied. When Majhee decided to go into global public health, Kai recommended that Majhee check out a research group at Unicamp doing humanitarian work and science education in addition to creating better tools for understanding one's own genetic profile and biases. Majhee went off to São Paulo while Kai stayed in Seoul for a few more years. When Majhee got her appointment as group leader at the Laboratório Nacional de Biociências e Saúde Pública, she contact Kai and begged her to come back to São Paulo and work with Majhee on eSyrup doping and splicing experiments.

The unifying aesthetic of the Biononymous cult are the hexagonal patterns of beehives. Each Green Haven, the name for Biononymous farming villages, has an additional motif involving a local flora and fauna. The local motif of Green Haven Howes, Asoka's home Haven, is the North American Beaver and the Sugar Maple. 

### Where is this character from?

Asoka was born in a Green Haven somewhere in the former United States of America. The Biononymous have continued to live in strict adherence to their religious principles: always wearing their full religious outfits and using synthesized, unidentifiable voices in public, in order to maintain their anonymity; cultivating cotton, hemp, and flax to transform into eSyrup textiles; and training every member of their cult in the ways of capoeira. By the time the World Government made itself known to the Earthers, the Biononymous were already back above ground in both North America and Europe, growing food for themselves and nearby Underground Cities on farms/monastaries/wildlife sanctuaries called Green Havens. The Biononymous had also established a form of benevolent governance and trade with the Underground Cities, nurturing culture and growth where the World Government expected to find only chaos and barbarians. The Biononymous have also now perfected eSyrup mechapets, which are synthetic creatures that can provide numerous technological/digital computing functions to the Biononymous, including instantaneous long-distance communication. Asoka is part of the first generation of the Biononymous who have been given a mechapet at birth, a companion who will grow and develop with the human child. 

The World Government was not pleased that they couldn't just take over the Green Havens and commandeer the Green Havens' agricultural resources. The World Government was desperate to find ways of feeding the Orbiter population, which was suddenly increased by about 60,000 during the Global Water Crisis. The World Government aggressively negotiated with the Biononymous, demanding a tithe of 30% of the Green Havens' yearly harvest, which would supplement the yield of the 3 orbiting space farms, in exchange for the World Government acknowledging the Biononymous as a legitimate political entity and allowing the Biononymous to continue practicing the tenents of their religion without interference. The Biononymous are wary of the World Government and their true motives, but as it was hard to argue with the need to feed people and a promise of non-interference, so the Biononymous agreed. However, the Biononymous become even more subtle and clever, now that they know that the World Government wants the Green Havens for themselves. A secret group of Biononymous begin working on new eSyrup textiles with greater camouflage and anti-surveillance properties.  

About 20 years later, enormous demonic beasts, later dubbed "Death Dogs", began appearing with horrifying frequency and begin terrorizing Green Havens in North America and Europe. These huge carvivorous creatures descend upon Green Havens and horribly mangle anyone they can get their teeth on. Usually, the entire population of a Green Haven is wiped out, crops are trampled, and buildings are destroyed. This happens to Asoka's Green Haven when Asoka is 15-years-old, and Asoka, who had been tending the most distant fields, just barely escapes with their mechapet Iri. 

### What does this character want?

At first, Asoka felt that establishing an alliance between the Biononymous and the Automata was their one true goal, but after the Elders decide to decline the alliance and the Automata go further into hiding, Asoka, feeling as though they failed, falls into a deep depression, and becomes bed-ridden. Min gets tired of seeing Asoka mope, so she finds Asoka and reminds them that if they do not want the deaths of their friends and family to be in vain, Asoka needs to live, and survive, and find a reason to stand every day. 

Min has decided that Asoka is cool enough to be her friend, so Min expresses her disappointment with the Elders' decision. Min shares with Asoka her desire to join the International Space Exploration Corps and become a space explorer. Stirred by Min's passion and ferocious energy, Asoka presents themselves to the Elders, and answers all of their questions about the Biononymous and Biononymous tech. Based on the new knowledge they gain from Asoka, the Automata are able to vastly improve their eSyrup bubbles, the flexible eSyrup-textile-based structures they use for shelter, which look very akin to big top circus tents. 

Over the next year, while living with the Automata, Asoka slowly recovers from the trauma and realises a new desire: to honour the deaths of their parents and their entire Green Haven, by figuring out a way to defeat the Death Dogs, to deny the World Government the power they so hungrily seek, and to free the Biononymous from oppression. Even though Asoka's parents kept Asoka out of the loop when it came to their research (in order to protect Asoka), Asoka still picked up their distrust of the World Government and their fear that the Biononymous' desire to live private lives, without hyper-documentation by a central authority, may soon be crushed. Reinforced by the insights of Eireena, Asoka realises that although the Biononymous are not trackable or surveillable as individuals, the whole cult is now trapped on the Green Havens, and the Biononymous may lose the leverage they've enjoyed as a religious organization to be free from government oversight. 

When Min declares her intenions to join the ISE Corps via the Space Asylum Program, Asoka decides to also apply to join the ISE Corps, and thus gain better access to the World Government. Asoka wants privacy and private spaces, and safe spaces that by definition must exclude, to have a place in the future of humanity. The World Government threatens that, and Asoka wants to discover if another form of governance is possible for a humanity now spread so far apart from each other, from deep caves to distant orbit. 

## Iri 

A cuttlefish mechapet and companion of Asoka. Iri can fluidly change its shape, colour, and texture, and is even able to spread out completely flat and camouflage well enough to be functionally invisible. 

### A note about mechapets

Asoka's generation is the first generation of Biononymous to have mechapets. 

Mechapets are made from flexible and deformable inorganic materials doped with eSyrup. The outer "skin" of every mechapet is actually a shell made of tiny eSyrup-doped metal plates, so small and connected with so many degrees of freedom that in concert, they can mimic any biological skin, fur, feather, and scale texture. 

Asoka's mechapet Iri is actually the "template" mechapet for all other mechapets. Akin to the similarities between the early stages of embryonic development across vertebrate species, all mechapets first develop into an amorphous 'cephalopod-like' structure, then are voltage-treated to differentiate their outer shell appearance to look like other animals, such as birds, reptiles, mammals, etc. The voltage-treatment on these other mechapet models changes the default configuration of their outer shell, meaning that once a mechapet has differentiated into a species besides the 'cephalopod-like' template, their new appearance is now the lowest energy state for their outer shell. With practice and experience, all mechapets can learn how to change the energy state of their outer shell, aka morph.

### Where is this character from?

Min is a member of the Automata, a nomadic clan dedicated to reviving the Amazon Rainforest. To do this, they study the soil, water, and air, constantly collecting samples and researching how to re-balance Earth's surface environment. They are mobile, moving in a seasonal cycle throughout the Amazon River Basin, tending groves of trees and wild gardens while avoiding contact with the Underground Cities and the World Government, in order to preserve their autonomy.  

The Automata believe true autonomy is the ability to make informed, un-coerced decisions. To the Automata, this implies that every member of their clan be raised with the skills and awareness required to govern themselves while co-existing with the rest of the world. Most members of the Automata interpret this collective awareness and responsibility to extend only towards other Earthers, and are happy to ignore the Orbiters, whom the Automata speak of dismissively as "the ones who abandoned us out of fear, who hide in their sterile coffins up in the sky."

When Automata children are considered adults by the Clan when they become an Expert in one of their crafts: Tree Surfer (one who studies and cares for trees and plants), Water Cycler (one who studies and cares for the water and waste cycles of the Automata), and Inker (one who studies and cares for the raw eSyrup cultures, secret treasure of the Automata). When an Automata has trained and proven their competence in a craft, they undergo the Rite of the Mothers - they must travel, with a single escort, to the sacred burial caves of the Automata, where a secret spring of clean, clear water, one of the rarest things in the modern world, bursts out of the cave rock. There they must meditate amongst their dead ancestors for 7 days, with no food and no speech during that time. 

After 7 days, their escort helps them return to the main body of the Clan, where they receive an injection of raw eSyrup directly into their skin. This injection becomes their **subdermal shield**, a layer of eSyrup in their skin, which connects directly with their nervous system. With guidance, discipline, and much practice, the Automata are able to modify their subdermal shield in order to give themselves protection from harmful solar radiations, to eat directly the fruits and vegetables grown in wild gardens, to drink surface water without intensive treatment and filtration, to filter the current atmosphere with their own sinuses. 

Once the subdermal shield has been fully assimilated by the individual, they are asked, "What does it mean to be Free?" These are the first words of every adult Automata; this is the question upon which they meditate in the sacred caves of the ancestors. Each Automata's answer is expected to share how they plan to spend their Year Underground - after 6 months of training on how to use their subdermal shield, Automata are expected to disguise themselves as Underground Earthers and spend a year living in the Underground Cities, to gain perspective on the Automata lifestyle and to generate closer empathy with their fellow planetside humans. 

The Automata work to re-grow the Amazon forest, using a variety of pioneer species. In areas where their re-forestation efforts are more mature, they have started growing [shihuahuaco trees](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112710007504). 

### What does this character want?

Thanks to growing up with a father who was not born into the Automata, Min grows up with a rather unique perspective, even before becoming an Expert Crafter and living with the Underground Earthers for a year. Amadou once dreamed of going into orbit and becoming a space explorer, and he passes on those dreams to Min. Min and Amadou spend many nights stargazing and pointing out planets and Orbiter structures, many dawns and dusks watching the Space Barges rumble through the atmosphere. Now that Amadou has a bounty on his head, he will never be able to ride a Space Barge without being taken into Peacekeeper custody or killed for money, a fact that causes him great sadness. 

Because of the influence of her father, Min grows to believe that in order to be truly informed and un-coerced in her decisions, she must also be informed about and un-coerced by the Orbiters. This, plus her father's love for space exploration, make Min want to apply to the International Space Exploration Corps. 

Just before meeting Asoka, Min undergoes the Rite of the Mothers. Her first words as an adult of the Automata, in answer to the question, "What does it mean to be Free?": "To drink without bleeding, to breathe without choking, to see the sky and greet the day in my own skin...and to MOVE in any direction with curiosity and grace...even OFF THE PLANET! Instead of spending a year underground, I choose to spend a year up in orbit, to learn what it's like to be an Orbiter, and how to co-exist with all of humanity, not just Earthers. I will apply to the International Space Exploration Corps through the Space Asylum Program, and complete an Orbiter rite of passage."**

Min also hates the World Government for punishing her father for killing an evil man, for allowing people to suffer in the name of "law and order". After meeting Asoka and learning about the World Government's treatment of the Biononymous, Min's anger towards the World Government grows to a fury, and Min realises that the Automata will inevitably have to face the World Government one day. When Asoka becomes horribly depressed after the Automata Elders decline an alliance with the Biononymous, Min also realises that she wants to be friends with Asoka. She tells Asoka about the ISE Corps, and the Space Asylum Program, and urges Asoka to apply. 

## Jina Suh Barbosa 

Jina is the daughter of Majhee Suh and Vec Barbosa. 

Birthday: November 20, 2079

When Jina spent her year in the Underground Cities, she met and fell in love with Amadou. Jina helps Amadou return to his home cave and overthrow the tyrannical governor. They succeed, but at a terribly high cost - many of the cave's residents died, including Amadou's parents. In the end, Amadou kills the tyrannical governor, and a more humane governing system was established. However, Amadou was now wanted by World Government Peacekeepers for killing a World Government appointed governor, so Jina brought him back with her to the Automata. This was the first time someone had returned from their year away with an Underground Earther, and it caused great debate amongst the Elders. In the end, they accept Amadou on the condition that he will be a "child" forever - he will never receive a subdermal shield.

# Future main characters (I don't think they will fit into this first story)

## Rhee 

Orbiter, member of the Seppellitori guild (guild of morticians and provider of death/burial rites). Fascinated by the macabre. Extremely meticulous and obsessed with good sanitary practices. Exacting and pragmatic, sometimes to the point of coldness. Incredibly sharp-witted and observant. 

Pronouns: She/her/hers

Phenotype: Mediterranean. Long, straight, hair that she keeps coloured purple. Light olive skin. Extremely petite, even smaller than Min. Large dark-green eyes and a slightly upturned nose. 

### Where does this character come from?

Rhee was born in orbit, to mortician parents who work for the Space Consortium. This places Rhee and her family amongst the upper echelon, but because they perform a function that Orbiters would rather not think about, Orbiters consider them to be on the lowest rung of Orbiter society. Rhee is tired of living a life of perfect convenience, tired of the dull routine on the Orbiter vessels, where everything is sterile and controlled and predictable. 

### What does this character want?

Rhee is tired of burying Earthers who come to Orbit for jobs with terrible conditions. She wants to do anything that isn't being a mortician, and she wants to have nothing to do with hiring Earthers to do the "dirty work." Rhee feels a great deal of guilt for being an Orbiter, having a social status that makes it easy for her to use Earthers for her convenience, and contributing to a social system that encourages the cruel treatment of the lower classes by the upper classes, the prejudice of Orbiters against Earthers, and the resentment of Earthers against Orbiters. 

## Rajue

Earther, member of the **CENTRAL AMERICAN** gang. Has a fierce temper and can fly into violent rages, especially when provoked by Orbiters. He was born to parents conscripted to work on the **RED ZONE TUNNELS** as essentially indentured slaves, digging in horrible conditions deep underground to connect the Underground Cities, often without proper protection from the toxic effects of air and soil closer to the surface. 

Pronouns: He/him/his

Phenotype: Columbian. Shorter than average for an Earther male. Compact body, well-muscled, with delicate facial features. Light coffee coloured skin, steely dark grey eyes surrounded by long dark lashes. 

### What does this character want?

Rajue was born in a small underground city ruled by a madman. His parents were one of the many people turned into slaves by their city ruler. When food supplies run short in the city, even after sending 50% of their able-bodied, over 18 population into orbit to work on the Space University Station construction, the madman ruler decides to kill all remaining adult male slaves. Rajue was forced to watch the execution of his father, and the fathers of his friends. After that, the madman ruler takes numerous female slaves and creates a harem. 

Rajue wants to get educated and rich as fast as possible, so that he never has to dig another tunnel ever again. He hates the World Gov with a fierce rage and deep smoldering resentment. He wants to leave behind all of the painful memories of now-dead loved ones and get as far away from planet Earth as possible. 

## Tross Grael Nicolau

Earther, member of the Automata Clan (Eurasia) and disguised as a member of the **METAL WORKERS OF BLACK SEA AREA** gang. Has a knack for metal working and extremely fond of animals, especially cats. Gentle giant who looks large and intimidating but is actually incredibly averse to violence. Grandson of Felix Grael, research colleague of Majhee Suh. 

Pronouns: He/him/his

Phenotype: Romanian/Dacia, with Swedish and Portuguese influences. Wide nose, large ears, hazel-green eyes with flecks of gold, unruly dirty blonde hair that sticks out in all directions. Full facial hair that he often forgets to trim or keep tidy. Large yet dextrous hands, skin the colour of tea-stained parchment paper, pock-marked with scars and stained with soot. Slim hips, broad shoulders, powerfully-muscled arms and legs.
