## Dream 1: Nostalgia

## Chapter 1: Calm Before the Storm

Character designs: Majhee Suh, Iúna Morei, Kai Oliveira, Beatriz Cavalcanti, Nova Jatobá, Vec Barbosa

We meet Dr. Majhee Suh and her research team in São Paulo, Brazil. They are in a race against Space Consortium to research and publish practical applications of the eSyrup technology before Space Consortium can patent those same applications. The research team discuss the various tensions they are facing due to taking on such a powerful enemy while also dealing with health issues of living in a heavily urbanized environment in the year 2066, when pollution chokes city-dwellers and the atmosphere fails to protect humans from harmful radiations of the sun. 

Somewhere in Massachusetts, USA, Iúna Morei meets with a rep from the World Health Organization in order to receive the latest splicing and voltage-treatment protocols for eSyrup-doped textiles. During this meeting, Iúna learns that a police raid in Los Angelos, California has triggered an enormous fire that is spreading up the coast of California and inland towards New Mexico. Iúna contacts fellow operatives of a secret organization that is trying to fight ubiquitous government surveillance, and they decide to declare themselves a religious organization, in order to continue their research into eSyrup textiles that can thwart surveillance while protecting their organization from government oversight. 

## Chapter 2: Where Thunder Goes When It Dies

Character designs: Majhee Suh, Iúna Morei, Kai Oliveira, Beatriz Cavalcanti, Nova Jatobá, Vec Barbosa, Nicola Cavalcanti

Numerous catastrophes around the world in the year 2067 culminate in a global environmental disaster, later dubbed "The Global Water Crisis" or "The Burning". 

Dr. Majhee Suh and the remaining members of her research team pack up as much research data, equipment, and resources as they can carry, then flee through nitric-acid-heavy rain and flood with their families to the Matto Grasso plateau.

People around the globe flee underground, mostly into caves, in order to escape the poisonous atmosphere and the acid rain and ocean. The Orbiters cut off all communication and transportation between orbit and planetside for 2 years before returning to Earth to declare themselves the **WORLD GOV** and demand food and other resources from the Earthers. 

## Chapter 3

Character designs: Asoka Morei, Iri, Eireena McLeland

Nearly 50 years later, we meet Asoka Morei, a child of the Biononymous cult, which grew out of the religious organization started by Iúna Morei back before The Burning. Asoka's Green Haven, the above-ground farming villages run by the Biononymous to feed the vast hungry masses living in underground caves, has been attacked by mysterious creatures called "Death Dogs". The "Death Dogs" look like enormous wolves the size of small elephants, and they seem to prey almost exclusively on humans. Asoka is the only survivor of the attack on their village and they beg a neighboring Green Haven for sanctuary. 

The neighboring Green Haven is run by High Priestess Eireena McLeland, who is visited by **WORLD GOV** Peacekeepers shortly after Asoka arrives to beg for sanctuary. The Peacekeepers offer to protect the Green Havens by installing a military presence in all of the Green Havens. Eireena and the governing council of her Green Haven are suspicious of the Peacekeepers' motives, but they have little choice but to accept and host a platoon of Peacekeepers. Because this is an extremely un-ideal situation in which to give sanctuary, Eireena comes up with an alternative offer for Asoka. 

## Chapter 4

Character designs: Asoka Morei, Iri, Eireena McLeland

Asoka travels into the "Red Zone" (wide stretch of equatorial zone circling the Earth, where it is too hot for even the Biononymous to cross; this zone harshly separates the Northern and Southern hemispheres) as a stowaway on a World Gov Peacekeeper naval vessel. During the journey, Asoka remembers Eireena's plan - to send Asoka with the Peacekeepers so that they can try to find the mysterious people in the Amazon, warn them of the Peacekeepers' arrival and their questionable motives, and offer these people an alliance with the Biononymous against the **WORLD GOV**. Eireena gifts Asoka with the fruits of a secret Biononymous eSyrup textile research program, which, turns out, Asoka's parents were involved in - eSyrup cloth that can change color and texture to blend into the surroundings perfectly and seamlessly, dubbed "cuttlefish skin". Asoka is to train the art of controlling this new kind of eSyrup cloth with the help of their mechapet Iri. Eireena then arranged to get Asoka onto the Peacekeeper naval vessel. During the journey, Iri swims in a real ocean for the first time. The Peacekeeper naval vessel finally arrives at the abandoned ruins of the ancient city of Manaus and docks. 

## Chapter 5

Character designs: Asoka Morei, Iri, Minka Oosou

Asoka rushed ahead of the Peacekeepers to the location that the **WORLD GOV** designated as the best spot to search for the mysterious Amazonian people, arriving much faster than the loud, noisy, bulky, slow-moving military troops. From that location, Asoka has been searching in an ever growing spiral, with no success. Just as Asoka is about to pass out from hunger and heatstroke, Iri discovers a cave with a false wall, behind which is a garden, clearly cultivated by *someone*. Asoka and Iri find an opening into the secret garden, which provides Asoka with food, water, and respite from the heat. Asoka is so grateful to be alive that they are completely caught unawares by Min, who doesn't recognise the Biononymous clothing and thinks that a ghost or evil spirit is raiding her garden. Min engages the stranger in combat, and knocks off Asoka's head veil. After realising that the evil spirit is actually a human, Min listens to Asoka as Asoka tells Min about the World Gov Peacekeepers. After Asoka has recovered enough to venture back out into the heat, Asoka shows Min the Peacekeepers as they noisily set up base camp and plow through the forest with no regard for the flora and fauna they are destroying. Furious, Min agrees to present Asoka to the Elders of her clan, the Automata. 

## Dream 2: Another Tree Surfer is Born

The Rite of the Mothers, the ceremony that marks the passing from childhood to adulthood within the Automata Clan. 

## Chapter 6

Character designs: Asoka Morei, Iri, Majhee Suh, Beatriz Cavalcanti, Breno Leite, Nova Jatobá, Jina Suh Barbosa, Amadou Touré 

Asoka tells the Elders of the Automata everything that the Biononymous know about the **WORLD GOV** and present the Biononymous' offer for alliance. The Elders debate the offer, and in the end decide to reject the alliance and move deeper into the Amazon, in the hopes that the Automata can avoid confrontation with the **WORLD GOV** indefinitely. The Elders offer to help Asoka return to the other side of the Red Zone, so that they can relay the Automata's response in person and return home. Asoka confesses that they are able to remotely broadcast the response to the other Biononymous, and besides, they had no more home to go back to. The Elders then offer Asoka asylum with the Automata and invite Asoka to come with them, in exchange for answering the questions of the Elders about the Biononymous and their technology. Fearful of the potential of betraying their dead parents, Asoka hesitates. Having few other options, Asoka accepts asylum with the Automata but asks for time to process before talking about their dead parents' and their research. Asoka uses Iri to relay the news back to Eireena - that the Automata have chosen to decline the offer of alliance, and have decided to go deeper into hiding. Eireena tells Asoka that more Peacekeepers have been stationed at every Green Haven, and that the **WORLD GOV** is now demanding 50% of the Green Havens' yearly yield, supposedly to feed the Peacekeepers who are keeping the Green Havens safe from the Death Dogs. Eireena shares her belief that the Death Dogs are creations of the **WORLD GOV**, meant to create an atmosphere of terror so that the **WORLD GOV** can subdue the planetside population into fearful obedience. Upon hearing this news, Asoka falls into a deep, dark depression. 

## Chapter 7: How we evolve

Character designs: Asoka Morei, Iri, Minka Oosou, Jina Suh Barbosa, Amadou Touré

Min goes to see Asoka and tries to stir Asoka out of their depression by telling Asoka that moping only dishonours the deaths of their Green Haven. Asoka lashes out - how could Min possibly understand how they feel? Min responds by telling Asoka the story of her parents, and how her father Amadou, who was born in an Underground City ruled by a terrible tyrant, lost his parents and nearly everyone he knew and loved in the effort to overthrow the tyrant. Amadou once dreamed of becoming a space explorer, but is now a wanted criminal with a bounty on his head because he killed the tyrant ruler of his home city, so there is no way he can leave the safety of asylum with the Automata. Min tells Asoka of her dream to become a space explorer in her father's stead, by applying to the International Space Exploration Corps via the Space Asylum Program, and encourages Asoka to do the same, reasoning that if Asoka wants to help the Biononymous fight the **WORLD GOV**, they don't need this alliance with the Automata - much more useful would be to go into orbit and learn more about the Orbiters, the principle actors in the **WORLD GOV**. Convinced, Asoka vows to get to the ISE Corps no matter what it takes. 

## Dream, the last: Comma, not a Period

Asoka and Min say their goodbyes as Min leaves to spend a year in the Underground Cities before applying to the ISE Corps.
