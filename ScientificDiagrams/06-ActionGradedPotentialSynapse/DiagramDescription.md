# Major Membrane Actions of the Nervous System

## Action vs Graded Potential

### Action Potential

Also known as a "nerve impulse", "spike", or "when a neuron fires". Occurs when the membrane potential of a specific axon location rapidly rises and falls due to the movement of charged particles. An action potential follows the physiological principle ["all or none"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-or-none_law), meaning that if an incoming signal does not push the membrane potential past a certain threshold, no "spike" will occur. 

* this is the electrical signal used by neurons to trigger the release of chemical signals at the synapse. Neurons do not "pass" electrical signals to each other (this is called a "gap junction") - instead, the Action Potential is the use of electricity to quickly trigger chemical signalling, especially when the synapse is very far (in relative distance) from the neuron cell body
* the electrical signal is generated by the flow of ions across the cell membrane
* ions used = sodium (Na+) and potassium (K+) ions
* the ions are able to cross the cell membrane thanks to voltage-gated protein channels, specific to each ion
* a sodium-potassium pump uses Adenosine Tri-phosphate (ATP, a molecule used for energy by all living cells) to push sodium and potassium ions against their concentration gradient to create the "resting potential"

### [Graded Potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graded_potential)

These are changes to the membrane potential that vary in size and do NOT follow the principle of "all-or-none". 

* arises from the summation of ligand-gated ion channel proteins, and typically does NOT involve voltage-gated sodium or potassium channels
* magnitude of graded potential depends on the strength of the incoming stimulus
* can be excitatory or inhibitory
* often used as a way of making the target cell more or less likely to fire an action potential

## Chemical Synapse

Synapse - a biological junction that lets neurons exchange signals with each other and other non-neuronal cells (glia, muscle, or gland cells). Includes a pre-synaptic membrane, a synaptic cleft, and a post-synaptic membrane.

* involves calcium (Ca2+) ions and vesicles full of neurotransmitters 
  * these vesicles were packaged in the soma by the endoplasmic reticulum, then travelled down the axon to wait in the axon terminal 
* when an action potential reaches the axon terminal, the electrical signal triggers an influx of calcium ions into the axon terminal
* the influx of calcium ions triggers the vesicles to fuse to the axon terminal membrane and release their neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft
* the neurotransmitters bind to receptor proteins on the post-synaptic membrane, which can trigger a number of actions by the post-synaptic cell
* glial cells called astrocytes collect neurotransmitters from the synaptic cleft and break them down into nutrients that can be fed back to neurons
