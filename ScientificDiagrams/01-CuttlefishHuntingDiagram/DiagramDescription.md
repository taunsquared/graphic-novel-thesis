# Cuttlefish Hunting Diagram

From my open lab notebook: http://www.danbeekim.org/open-lab-notebook/cuttlefish-hunting-behavior/

In the table of contents, navigate to the section "Hunting Behaviour Ethogram", nested under the section "Analysis". 

The 4 main phases I would like to show are "at rest", "attention", "positioning", and "seizure" (which I specify as the 'tentacles go ballistic' or TGB moment). The interesting thing here is the body pattern that appears at that TGB moment - to a visual predator, like us, this body pattern is very conspicuous and makes the cuttlefish stand out a lot during what is arguably one of its most vulnerable moments. 

Another interesting aspect of this body pattern is that it lingers (for many seconds) when the animal makes a successful catch; whereas, when it makes a tentacle shot and misses the target, the TGB body pattern shows up very briefly and then disappears quite quickly. I definitely want to showcase this phenomena in this diagram.

I'll be updating the above linked page with more quantitative characterizations of the TGB moment.
