# Feedback on proofs

Oooo, so cute!! Haha I love the comedic elements! I'm happy with either open or boxed layout. Can we add a "bird's eye view" of each stage as well, so that we see the mantle (back) pattern very clearly throughout the entire hunting sequence?

It would be cool to have the "bird's eye view" show the changes to body pattern as "seen" by the Canny algorithm: https://youtu.be/TGo0AM7calI?t=427

I am working on getting some actual quantitative data for this! I need to have the computer count the edges it finds for each frame and then plot this for every video I have...will have these plots to you by the end of next week! In the meanwhile, can you leave some space for adding plots to each phase of the hunting sequence?
