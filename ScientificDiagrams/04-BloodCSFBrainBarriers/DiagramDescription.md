# The 4 Blood/CSF/Brain Barriers

The Ventricular System consists of 4 interconnected cavities/ventricles/tunnels where [cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrospinal_fluid) is produced and circulated. The ventricular system of the brain is connected to the central canal of spinal cord, and creates 4 barriers between brain tissue, blood vessels, and CSF ventricles: Blood-brain barrier, Blood-CSF barrier, Brain-CSF barrier, CSF-brain barrier. 

I have put some very rough sketches by me into this folder. They are basically variations (and more poorly drawn versions) of [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood–brain_barrier#/media/File:Protective_barriers_of_the_brain.jpg). 

Below are my written descriptions of each type of barrier. 

## [Blood-brain barrier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood–brain_barrier)

This is a barrier created by [tight junctions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tight_junction) between the endothelial cells (which make up the inner lining of blood vessels and lymphatic vessels) of capillaries in the central nervous system (CNS). Specifically, the blood-brain barrier separates circulating blood from the extracellular fluid surrounding CNS cells, restricting the diffusion of bacteria and large or hydrophillic molecules while allowing the diffusion of hydrophobic molecules (like O2, CO2, and hormones) and small polar molecules. Additional cells involved in this barrier include: 
* astrocyte cell projections called "astrocytic feet" or [glia limitans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glia_limitans)
* [pericytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pericyte)

## [Blood-CSF barrier, aka the Choroid Plexus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choroid_plexus)

## Brain-CSF barrier, aka the Pia-arachnoid

The Pia-arachnoid is a term to jointly refer to the [arachnoid mater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arachnoid_mater) and the [pia mater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pia_mater), which are two layers of the [meninges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meninges)

## CSF-brain barrier, aka the Neuro[ependyma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ependyma)
