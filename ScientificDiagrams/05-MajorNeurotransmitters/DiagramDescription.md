# Major Neurotransmitters: "Big Picture" model of how neurotransmitters work

## Which neurotransmitters are most often used

Central Nervous System --> Glutamate (excitatory), GABA (inhibitory)  
Peripheral Nervous System (neuro-muscular junction) --> Acetylcholine  
Enteric Nervous System --> Seratonin (often abbreviated as 5-HT)

## How are the neurotransmitters used

[A single neuron can release multiple neurotransmitters](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10818/). Once released, neurotransmitters can act on the post-synaptic cell in different ways depending on the post-synaptic cell's receptors. 

## 2 broad categories of neurotransmitter receptors

### Ionotropic

Ionotropic receptors are protein structures in the cell membrane that form an [ion channel pore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel_pore). When a neurotransmitter binds to this receptor, the proteins create an opening for ions such as sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), calcium (Ca2+), and/or chloride (Cl-) to travel into or out of the cell. 

These receptors tend to cause very fast reactions in the post-synaptic cell (on the order of milliseconds), by either [depolarizing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depolarization) the cell and causing an excitatory response, or by [hyperpolarizing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperpolarization_(biology)) the cell and causing an inhibitory response.  

Ionotropic receptors are classified into 3 major groups, called "superfamilies": [cys-loop receptors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cys-loop_receptor), [ionotropic glutamate receptors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamate-gated_ion_channel_family), and [ATP-gated channels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P2X_purinoreceptor). 

#### Cys-loop receptors

In vertebrates, these receptors can have binding sites for acetylcholine (AcCh), serotonin, glycine, glutamate and Î³-aminobutyric acid (GABA). 

#### Ionotropic glutamate receptors

These receptors have binding sites specifically for glutamate, and mediate the majority of excitatory synaptic transmission in the central nervous system. They are an important part of the molecular biochemical mechanisms that allow nervous system cells to strengthen or weaken their connections to each other, aka [synaptic plasticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synaptic_plasticity). If one assumes that memory is a phenomenon that emerges from the connections between nervous system cells, synaptic plasticity can be considered a key neuro-chemical mechanism for learning and memory (this idea is based on the [Hebbian theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebbian_theory)). 

Ionotropic glutamate receptors can be divided into 4 major subtypes: AMPA receptors

### Metabotrophic



# More details (old stuff)

## Amino acids

These are organic compounds containing an amine group and a carboxyl group, plus a "side chain" specific to each amino acid. 

The major amino acid neurotransmitters: 

### Glutamate

* anion (negatively charged ion) of glutamic acid
* most common neurotransmitter in human brain - excitatory at >90% of synapses
* important for regulating growth and development of dendrites and axons
* stored in vessicles at chemical synapses
* action-potential-triggered release of glutamate is important for synaptic plasticity (ability of synapses to strengthen or weaken over time, in response to increase or decrease in their activity)
* precursor to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)

### GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid)

* 2nd most prevalent neurotransmitter
* inhibitory at >90% of synapses that aren't using glutamate

### Other examples

aspartate, glycine, D-serine

## Monamines

These are neurotransmitters and neuromodulators that contain an aromatic ring connected to an amino group via a 2-carbon chain.

Definitions:

* neuromodulators: neurotransmitters that diffuse through neural tissue to affect slow-acting receptors of many neurons. Spends a lot of time in the cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF). 
* aromatic ring: circular/ring-shaped and flat ("planar") molecule that is very stable

Examples of monamines include: 

### Dopamine

* important during reward-motivated behaviour
* anticipation of most types of reward increases dopamine levels in brain
* many addictive drugs increase dopamine or block re-uptake after release. 
* involved in motor control
* involved in controlling the release of certain hormones

### Seratonin

* majority (~90%) of seratonin in human body is found in enteric nervous system (located in gastrointestinal tract). 
* also produced in brain stem
* regulates intestinal movement, appetite, sleep
* influences mood

### Adrenaline (aka epinephrine)

* increases blood flow to muscles
* increases volume of blood pumped by heart
* increases pupil dilation and blood sugar levels

### Noradrenaline (aka norepinephrine)

* mobilizes brain and body for action
* release is lowest during sleep, higher when awake, much higher during stress or danger
* increases arousal and alertness
* promotes vigilance
* enhances formation and retrieval of memory
* focuses attention
* increases restlessness and anxiety

### Histamine

* involved in regulating sleep-wake cycle
* can suppress neural activity to protect against convulsions, drug sensitization, stress, denervation supersensitivity, and ischemic lesions

definitions:

* denervation supersensitivity: sharp increase in the sensitivity of the post-synaptic membrane to a chemical transmitter after nerve injury ("denervation")
* ischemic lesion: lesion = "injury". so this is an injury to brain tissue caused by  insufficient blood flow to brain, leading to lack of sufficient oxygen and cell death.

## Gasotransmitters

These are gas molecules that meet the following criteria, first created in 2002:
* it is a small molecule of gas
* freely permeable to membranes (doesn't need to rely on membrane proteins to have an effect on the cell)
* endogenounly and exogenously generated, and its production is regulated. 
* has well-defined and specific functions at physiologically relevant concentrations
* functions of the endogenous gas can be mimicked by its exogenous counterpart
* this gas should have specific cellular and molecular targets

Examples: nitric oxide, carbon monoxide, hydrogen sulfide

## Trace Amines

* related to monamines but present in "trace" (very tiny) concentrations
* Important for regulating the quantity/amount of monamine neurotransmitters are in the synaptic cleft
* promote the release and prevent re-uptake of monamine neurotranmitterns from synaptic cleft.
* inhibit the firing of action potentials

Examples: phenethylamine, tryptamine, octopamine

## Peptides

These are short (approx. less than 50 amino acids) chains of amino acids. Examples: cocaine-and-amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART), Somatostasin.

## Purines

* heterocyclic aromatic organic compound, consists of a pyrimidine ring fused to an imidazole ring
* pyrimidine: has nitrogen atoms at positions 1 and 3
* imidazole: organic compound, formula = C3N2H4

Examples: ATP, adenosine

## Other

we are still discovering new neurotransmitters! And often they don't fit into any of the categories mentioned above. 

Example: acetylcholine (used at neuromuscular junction, released by motor neurons to activate muscles).
