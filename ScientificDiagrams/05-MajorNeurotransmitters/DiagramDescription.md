# Major Neurotransmitters

## Amino acids

These are organic compounds containing an amine group and a carboxyl group, plus a "side chain" specific to each amino acid. 

The major amino acid neurotransmitters: 

### Glutamate

* anion (negatively charged ion) of glutamic acid
* most common neurotransmitter in human brain - excitatory at >90% of synapses
* important for regulating growth and development of dendrites and axons
* stored in vessicles at chemical synapses
* action-potential-triggered release of glutamate is important for synaptic plasticity (ability of synapses to strengthen or weaken over time, in response to increase or decrease in their activity)
* precursor to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)

### GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid)

* 2nd most prevalent neurotransmitter
* inhibitory at >90% of synapses that aren't using glutamate

### Other examples

aspartate, glycine, D-serine

## Monamines

These are neurotransmitters and neuromodulators that contain an aromatic ring connected to an amino group via a 2-carbon chain.

Definitions:

* neuromodulators: neurotransmitters that diffuse through neural tissue to affect slow-acting receptors of many neurons. Spends a lot of time in the cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF). 
* aromatic ring: circular/ring-shaped and flat ("planar") molecule that is very stable

Examples of monamines include: 

### Dopamine

* important during reward-motivated behaviour
* anticipation of most types of reward increases dopamine levels in brain
* many addictive drugs increase dopamine or block re-uptake after release. 
* involved in motor control
* involved in controlling the release of certain hormones

### Seratonin

* majority (~90%) of seratonin in human body is found in enteric nervous system (located in gastrointestinal tract). 
* also produced in brain stem
* regulates intestinal movement, appetite, sleep
* influences mood

### Adrenaline (aka epinephrine)

* increases blood flow to muscles
* increases volume of blood pumped by heart
* increases pupil dilation and blood sugar levels

### Noradrenaline (aka norepinephrine)

* mobilizes brain and body for action
* release is lowest during sleep, higher when awake, much higher during stress or danger
* increases arousal and alertness
* promotes vigilance
* enhances formation and retrieval of memory
* focuses attention
* increases restlessness and anxiety

### Histamine

* involved in regulating sleep-wake cycle
* can suppress neural activity to protect against convulsions, drug sensitization, stress, denervation supersensitivity, and ischemic lesions

definitions:

* denervation supersensitivity: sharp increase in the sensitivity of the post-synaptic membrane to a chemical transmitter after nerve injury ("denervation")
* ischemic lesion: lesion = "injury". so this is an injury to brain tissue caused by  insufficient blood flow to brain, leading to lack of sufficient oxygen and cell death.

## Gasotransmitters

These are gas molecules that meet the following criteria, first created in 2002:
* it is a small molecule of gas
* freely permeable to membranes (doesn't need to rely on membrane proteins to have an effect on the cell)
* endogenounly and exogenously generated, and its production is regulated. 
* has well-defined and specific functions at physiologically relevant concentrations
* functions of the endogenous gas can be mimicked by its exogenous counterpart
* this gas should have specific cellular and molecular targets

Examples: nitric oxide, carbon monoxide, hydrogen sulfide

## Trace Amines

* related to monamines but present in "trace" (very tiny) concentrations
* Important for regulating the quantity/amount of monamine neurotransmitters are in the synaptic cleft
* promote the release and prevent re-uptake of monamine neurotranmitterns from synaptic cleft.
* inhibit the firing of action potentials

Examples: phenethylamine, tryptamine, octopamine

## Peptides

These are short (approx. less than 50 amino acids) chains of amino acids. Examples: cocaine-and-amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART), Somatostasin.

## Purines

* heterocyclic aromatic organic compound, consists of a pyrimidine ring fused to an imidazole ring
* pyrimidine: has nitrogen atoms at positions 1 and 3
* imidazole: organic compound, formula = C3N2H4

Examples: ATP, adenosine

## Other

we are still discovering new neurotransmitters! And often they don't fit into any of the categories mentioned above. 

Example: acetylcholine (used at neuromuscular junction, released by motor neurons to activate muscles).
