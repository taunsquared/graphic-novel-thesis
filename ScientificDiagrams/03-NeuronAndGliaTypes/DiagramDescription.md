# Neuron and Glia Types

## Neuron classification by structure

### [Unipolar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unipolar_neuron)

A unipolar neuron has only one ["neuronal process"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurite) extending out of its body. Unipolar neurons are common in insects. [Unipolar brush cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unipolar_brush_cell) were first described in 1977 in the rat cerebellar cortex. 

### [Bipolar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_neuron)

* two long processes extend from the neuron soma
* specialized sensory neurons
* found in retina, vestibular nerve (hearing, equilibrium, motion detection), and spinal ganglia

### [Pseudounipolar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudounipolar_neuron)

* single long process that splits into two branches
* a type of sensory neuron in the peripheral nervous system
* its one process is an axon (carries info away from soma) with 2 branches - 
  * "peripheral branch": goes to skin, joints, muscles
  * "central branch": goes to spinal cord
* soma is located within dorsal root ganglia

### [Multipolar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multipolar_neuron)

* soma is surrounded by many small, branching processes, and one long process (axon)
* motor neurons and interneurons
* found mostly in cortex of brain, spinal cord, and autonomic ganglia

### [Anaxonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaxonic_neuron)

* a neuron where the axon cannot be differentiated from the dendrites purely based on structure
* found in brain and retina of vertebrates
* also found in some invertebrates
* act as non-spiking neurons, which use graded potentials (as opposed to action potentials) to effect the fidelity, strength, and lifetime of a neuronal signal
* modulate directional and posture coordinating behaviours
* these are the neurons in the brain that do not fit the metaphor of brains to computers
  * neurons that are "spiking" are considered "all or nothing" - this means that unless the neuron gets enough electrical input to make it "fire", it will do nothing at all. 
  * spiking neurons seem very similar to logic gates in silicon chips (found in computers, smartphones, etc), which are binary and are either "on" or "off". 
  * non-spiking neurons can send signals in a more analog fashion, and can influence the electrical excitability of spiking neurons

## Major Glial cell types

Also known as neuroglia or glial cells, these non-neuronal cells of the nervous system have 4 main functions: 

* surround neurons and hold them in place
* supply nutrients and oxygen to neurons
* insulate neurons from each other
* destroy germs and remove dead neurons

### Macroglia of the Peripheral Nervous System

#### Schwann cells

* provide myelin sheaths to neurons in the PNS
* eat germs
* clear cellular debris to help PNS neurons regrow

#### Satellite cells

* surround neurons in sensory, sympathetic, and parasympathetic ganglia
* help regulate external chemical environment
* interconnected by gap junctions
* respond to ATP by increasing concentration of Ca2+
* highly sensitive to inflammation and pain
* contribute to pathological states of diseases such as chronic pain

### Macroglia of the Central Nervous System

#### Oligodendrocytes

* cells that coat axons of neurons in the CNS with their cell membranes to form myelin sheaths
* a single oligodendrocyte can serve up to 50 axons
* last cell type to be generated in the CNS
* discovered in 1921 by Spanish neuroscientist Pio del Rio Hortega

#### Astrocytes (astroglia)

* most abundant macroglia in CNS
* link neurons to blood supply while helping form blood-brain barrier
* remove excess K+ from around neurons
* recycle neurotransmitters released during synaptic transmission
* signal to each other using ATP
* 2 main physiological forms:
  * protoplasmic - short, thick, highly branched processes. Most often found in grey matter.
  * fibrons - long, thin, less branched processes. Most often found in white matter. 
  
#### Ependymal cells (or ependymocytes)

* line the spinal cord and the ventricular system of brain to create the ependyma
* involved in creation and secretion of cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF)
* beat their cilia to help circulate CSF
* may act as "resevoir cells" - can generate new neurons but the ependymal cells become depleted, therefore not technically stem cells
* part of the blood-CSF barrier

### Microglia

* found in all regions of brain and spinal cord
* much smaller relative to macroglia
* change shape in order to move around nervous system
* multiply when brain is damaged
* constantly sample their environment in order to direct immune system responses to damage or danger in the nervous system

### Other...??!! 

We are still discovering more glial cells that may or may not fit into the above categories! This is an open area of research and discovery!
