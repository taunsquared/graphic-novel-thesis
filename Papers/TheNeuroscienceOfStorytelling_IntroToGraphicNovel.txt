Main point: Storytelling has proven to be a compelling form of information transfer, knowledge building and organization, and social coordination ever since humans became a distinct species. Over 300,000 years later, we are still telling stories, but in a society driven to specialize and compartmentalize skills and knowledge, we've relegated storytelling into a box that limits its application to entertainment. Given the evidence that storytelling engages the brain more powerfully than does any other communication format, I argue that education and research, especially in relation to neuroscience, can benefit enormously from collaborations and co-creations with artists and crafters who deliberately engage in storytelling.
