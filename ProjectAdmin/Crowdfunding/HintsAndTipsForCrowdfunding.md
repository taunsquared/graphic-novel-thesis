A short list of basic hints and tips for crowdfunding :)

# Crowdfunding campaign landing page

The name of campaign page should be short, sweet, and very descriptive, not just the title of your project/show/book.

People want to support stories. The opening paragraph should convey the main concept of the project/show/book in one sentence, followed quickly by what the people involved do and why the project/show/book will be a success. Use terms that are easy to digest, and don't introduce any jargon in the first paragraph. The first paragraph needs to catch someone's attention even if they are a complete stranger. Put plenty of time into this first paragraph, it will definitely be worth it. 

Everything needs to work both with or without the campaign video. The video is a standalone part of the campaign, that can convey everything you want conveyed without requiring people to read any of the text. Similarly, the text needs to catch people's attention and be engaging enough even for people who never watch the video. 

After the opening paragraph, the next section needs to be for people who are deciding to give or not to give. Share the process of creating the project/show/book. Make readers think, "oh I see, this is money well spent, I'm supporting [education/art/cultural exchange/refugees/social justice/etc]!"

If people have read this far, they have decided to give money, so tell them what they'll get when they support your campaign - the perks, the stretch goals. 

# Fundraising goals

For an all-or-nothing scheme like Kickstarter, set your basic fundraising goal to be the absolute minimum necessary to make the project/show/book happen in a "bare bones" manner. For anything extra, make those stretch goals, to ensure that you at least get your money. 

Stretch goals that are in small baby steps are ideal, but don't make extra work for yourself - each stretch goal is actually a subgoal of your project/show/book in disguise, just phrased as an "extra goodie" to the reader. 

# Getting ready to launch

Months before you launch, create a mailing list for people who like the main concept of your project/show/book, and build a community around supporting the manifestation of this concept. Create a dialogue, get personal, be vulnerable. Create a safe space for people to express their feelings about your main concept. Have fun with this community. 

Tell people you know personally to donate on the first day. The more activity you can generate in the first 24 hours, the more attention you'll get via the default algorithms on Kickstarter/IngieGoGo algorithms, and get highlighted on feature pages. 

Contact journalist friends, friends who run radio shows or publish podcasts, friends who write blogs, friends who admin online forums or social media groups, and ask if they can share a short press story about your campaign the week before, day before, and/or the day of the campaign launch. 

Work with the Kickstarter/IndieGoGo team before you launch - they want to have different project featured every week. Email them to ask them for advice, get them involved in the process so that they also feel invested in your campaign. 

# Other reminders

People who back crowdfunding campaigns don't usually know what they are doing - they just want to feel like they are spending their money well, on a good cause. They want something to feel good about. So tell them how they will feel good if they give their money to you. 

Don't be shy! Tell everyone you know, and tell them over and over and over again about your crowdfunding campaign. Once you've launched, make at least one social media post about your campaign per day of the campaign (or at least until you've hit your basic goal), ideally with good visuals to go with each post. Again, don't make extra work for yourself - re-use what you've created, either for the campaign landing page or from the project/show/book itself (without giving away the entire final product).

work with kickstarter team beforehand - they want to have different projects featured every week. email them and ask them for advice!



Because the graphic novel is part of my official thesis document, it must be 100% complete by the time I submit my thesis in October 2019. The artists have been incredibly supportive and have continued work on the graphic novel even without a guarantee of complete payment, so all of the artwork is already complete. I am currently editing the dialogue and formatting the pages for printing. 

I have also already contacted a publishing company which specialises in publishing independent, first-time comic book authors (https://comicprintinguk.com/ -- check them out, they're super friendly and knowledgable!), and they have agreed to print the graphic novel when it is ready.

Studying the unexpected in a clean and controlled laboratory can be difficult, so we've moved our research out of the lab and "into the wild", by building experiments embedded in exhibits and installations, or by re-purposing mobile electronics to create portable experiments. I also study how humans imagine and prepare for the unexpected, which is why I wrote The First VIRS, a science fiction graphic novel that combines cutting-edge science and technology into a story that imagines how the next 100 years might play out, and what it might be like to be a teenager in this possible future based on our current reality.
