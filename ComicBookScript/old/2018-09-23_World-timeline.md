# World timeline

### 2040

Education is still in crisis, cities are overcrowded, and rural communities are dying. Many of the scientists and engineers who once worked with Elon Musk and SpaceX have gone on to establish The Space Consortium, which has just established a research base on Mars. 

### 2041

A mutant yeast culture that can eat glass is accidentally cultivated by genetics researchers. They make note of the process that produced this yeast mutant in an online, freely accessible publication on "failed" genetically engineered yeast biofactories. 

### 2045

Space Consortium presents the United Nations with a proposal to collaborate with the UN Green Havens, areas of the world set aside to preserve Earth's agricultural traditions and provide biodiversity sanctuaries, in order to conduct research into exo-hydroponics (plants useful for space travel) and permaculture in low gravity. The Space Consortium offers to help fight the global food shortage with food grown in space. The Space Consortium also resurrects the idea of a reusable low Earth orbital spacecraft system, akin to the US Space Shuttle program of late 20th century, in order to transport resources back and forth between orbiting farms and planetside. The UN grants them a 10-year research and development grant. 

### 2048

Space Consortium successfully launches its first reusable space shuttle designed for humans and large cargo, which orbits the Earth once and returns planetside. 

### 2050

The first wave of pollution-related epidemics causes severe population reduction in several densely populated tropical areas in South America, Africa, and Southeast Asia. Ozone hole over Antarctic is measured to be the biggest its ever been.

### 2051

The Space Consortium publishes papers on several new species of food plants, genetically modified to thrive in low-gravity. 

### 2053

Space Consortium begins launching pieces of its first Orbital arboretum. 

### 2056

Majhee, a young PhD student in organometallic chemistry, discovers the 2041 publication about the "failed" yeast biofactory that ate its own glass vial. She decides to replicate it, then accidentally cultures it with lactic acid bacteria in the air and synthesizes the first eSyrup. 

Researchers successfully dope eSyrup onto a series of inorganic materials, including steel, aluminum, copper, brass, and glass.





Majhee and her colleagues present a proposal to the United Nations to develop affordable and sustainable eSyrup air/water filters, and eSyrup textiles to protect humans from solar radiation. Because eSyrup requires only water and silica, people should be able to harvest what silica that they need from local sand, rocks, recycled glass, and even certain plants. They are awarded a 10-year research and development grant, which earns Majhee a position as research group leader at the Laboratório Nacional de Biociências e Saúde Pública.   

### 2067

Space Consortium's first Orbital arboretum, **THE PEGGY WHITSON MEMORIAL SPACE ARBORETUM**, is completed. 

Majhee and her colleagues successfully dope eSyrup onto organic materials such as wool, cotton, polyester, and rubber. 

### 2068 

The Laboratório Nacional de Biociências e Saúde Pública, the publicly-funded research institute where Majhee and her colleagues conduct eSyrup research, is approached by the Space Consortium, who are interested in developing their own products with eSyrup and are looking to collaborate. Based on the freely available, online recipe for raw eSyrup, the Space Consortium believes that eSyrup can also serve as a replacement for rocket fuel. This would allow Space Consortium to make space farming even more efficient and cost-effective. The President of the Laboratório Nacional de Biociências e Tecnologia agrees to the collaboration, sparking criticism and protests. 

The Space Consortium reports successful harvest of crops grown in low gravity, more than enough to feed the crew aboard **THE PEGGY WHITSON MEMORIAL SPACE ARBORETUM**. 

Majhee and her collaborators begin distributing eSyrup air and water filters via the World Health Organization and Doctor's Without Borders to countries in the "Global South".

While conducting their own research on more efficient ways to dope eSyrup onto textiles, Iúna and her collaborators discover that eSyrup can provide alternative means for long-distance, wireless communication. 

### 2069 

First Space Barge makes its virgin flight to **THE PEGGY WHITSON MEMORIAL SPACE ARBORETUM**. The Space Consortium begins distributing their first excess yield of orbit-grown crops to planetside countries in need.

Jina is born in São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.

### 2070

Majhee and her colleagues successfully design a manufacturing process that dopes eSyrup onto textiles and allows end-users to customize the voltage-treatment of the fabric. 

First Orbital home pod is successfully launched from the **PEGGY WHITSON MEMORIAL SPACE ARBORETUM**. Within months, nearly 200 home pods are successfully launched, with residents. 

The first commercial subdermal eSyrup products become available in global markets. Many of these are invented and patented by the Space Consortium, drawing harsh criticism. 

### 2071  

Amadou is born in Monte Alegre, Pará, Brazil.

Majhee's husband and Jina's father, Cauã Furtado Neves, dies from malignant melanoma skin cancer. 

### 2072

In collaboration with the Laboratório Nacional de Biociências e Saúde Pública, the Space Consortium develops eSyrup fuel, which when liquid, can replace rocket fuel, and when voltage-treated to become solid, can provide rechargable portable power equivalent to a conventional battery at least 20 times larger by volume. The Space Consortium begins to mass-manufacture commercial eSyrup products, which they can make tiny and flexible thanks to the properties of eSyrup fuel. However, unlike all of the other eSyrup products developed so far, the Space Consortium demands that they be allowed to have proprietary access and rights to eSyrup fuel for at least 10 years. This sparks rigorous protests throughout the world, and the Laboratório Nacional de Biociências e Tecnologia refuses to agree. The Space Consortium takes legal action, and is granted right to profits. 

Space Consortium's second Orbital arboretum, **THE LOWER ESTATES SPACE ARBORETUM**, is completed. Orbiter population is now 1,000. Space Consortium immediately begins construction on a third orbiting arboretum, experimenting with orbit-based construction methods. 

### 2073  

The Space Barge fleet, comprising of 34 vessels, now makes daily trips from the Earth's surface to the Space Consortium's two Orbital stations.

Majhee and her colleagues begin distributing eSyrup protective clothing via the World Health Organization and Doctor's Without Borders to countries in need. 

eSyrup body mods are now quite popular. Many have subdermally inserted eSyrup chips that can replace all of the functionality of "smart mobile phones" that were commonplace during the early 21st century. eSyrup clothing are also starting to become part of high-fashion clothing labels, initially marketed as luxury clothing that can morph color, texture, and shape. Some industries are providing their employees with company-subsidized occupationally-specific body mods.  

### 2074

Orbiter population reaches 8,000.  

The Space Consortium establishes the **International Space Barge Corps** in order to sustain interest in space exploration into the next generation, and to find the best and the brightest for their projects. Youth from around the world spend 1-3 years at various planet-side launch stations learning about space travel and communication while helping maintain the space barges that can carry humans, equipment, and other resources back and forth between the space arboretums and planetside. The ISB Corps is a year-round pre-university training institution that prepares youth for Space University (which is in turn affiliated with several nations' military and space exploration departments), and it quickly becomes popular amongst the well-educated elite of the world.

The Biononymous, a cult-like religious movement that forbids the use of body mods and surgical eSyrup implants, is founded. The Biononymous believe that eSyrup mods will lead to direct biological data harvesting, malicious bio-hacking, and oppressive surveillance. One of the founders of the Biononymous, Raquel Morei, is a volunteer for the World Health Organization and the owner of several textile manufacturing plants, and develops a secretive textile research program to create eSyrup clothing that will not only protect wearers from harmful solar radiations, but will also prevent any wireless transmissions from entering or exiting their bodies/clothing, and will obscure their presence on surveillance cameras, many of which use infrared light. The Biononymous movement becomes particularly popular at the UN Green Havens.

### 2075 

eSyrup clothing and accessories of all kinds are now widely available, and secondhand stores and charity shops even have eSyrup items on a regular basis. 

The River Niger also dries up, causing panic in Africa. An extremely aggressive water-borne disease wipes out several major urban areas in China and India. Illnesses from sun radiation, such as skin cancer, have a thousand-fold jump in rate of diagnosis around the world. 

Raquel Morei gives birth to João Morei in Randolph Center, Vermont, USA.

### 2076

The Space Consortium completes **UPPER ESTATES SPACE ARBORETUM**, their third orbiting arboretum and first space station built entirely in orbit (but still using raw resources refined planetside). 

Majhee and her colleagues successfully create the first eSyrup biofilm made of eSyrup and the cyanobacteria *Anabaena*. 

The Colorado River dries up completely, which throws North America into chaos. A fire in a large high-rise apartment in an outer slum of San Francisco, ignited during a police raid looking for illegal eSyrup products, escalates into a city-wide blaze, thanks to the severe drought in the area and the huge prevalence of petroleum-based plastic furniture and objects in most homes. The burning city spreads all the way down the Californian coast, which is now one monstrous suburban sprawl, all the way past the border into Mexico. The fire also spreads inland towards the Colorado River Basin area, now parched by drought. 

### 2077: The Global Water Crisis, or, **THE BURNING OCEANS**

A deep-sea silica harvesting rig in the Antarctic Convergence accidentally vents deep-sea volcanic plumes, full of [silicon tetrafluoride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_tetrafluoride), directly into the air above the ocean from a leak just below the surface. This creates a huge cloud of hydrogen flouride and transforms the surrounding ocean into a deadly sea of hydroflouric acid. The poisonous cloud blinds the rig's crew, and the hydroflouric acid boils anyone who falls into the ocean, so the deep-sea volcanic plumes belch unchecked into the Antarctic Convergence. Ocean currents spread the hydroflouric acid into the Indian Ocean Gyre, the Southern Pacific Gyre, and the Southern Atlantic Gyre, destroying ecosystems and utterly disrupting the water cycle on the planet. The enormous cloud of hydrogen flouride is picked up by global wind currents and spreads throughout the atmosphere. Panic leads to military action, riots, and an incredible death toll. 

Meanwhile, in São Paulo, Majhee and her colleagues have just one year ago successfully spliced eSyrup with eukaryotic cell cultures for the first time, and now they are witnessing the birth of the first eSyrup-spliced mammal, a rat-like creature named Nimh. Nimh lives 11 days. Nimh dies on the day that the news of the deep-sea silica harvesting rig disaster reaches the Laboratório Nacional de Biociências e Saúde Pública. Majhee and her colleagues pack up all of their raw eSyrup cultures and research and flee with their families inland. They hide with friends and family in caves deep under the Amazon Rainforest. 

Iúna flees with her son João into caves in Vermont to escape the huge clouds of hydrogen flouride.

Amadou and his parents flee to the caves beneath Green Haven Santarém, in the Pará province of Brazil. 

Massive fluctuations of electromagnetic radiation from sun flares completely disrupt digital computing technology infrastructure. The vast majority of servers worldwide are wiped clean. 

Amid the chaos, nearly 60,000 planetside humans swarm onto Space Barges to flee into orbit. The Space Barges are overcrowded and the Space Consortium fears that too many people will try to come up into orbit and overload their resources, so they decide that, after one last trip, the Space Barges would remain docked at the Orbital stations and not return to planetside until planetside has stabilized. 

### 2079

The Earth's surface environment continues to spiral into drought, extreme weather, and hyper-salination of surface fresh water sources. Those still surviving on the planet, numbering around 4 billion, have taken refuge in caves all over the world, seeking respite from the sun and searching for aquafirs of clean water deep underground. Humans become nocturnal, coming above ground only at night, if at all. 

Majhee and her collective of 67 humans establish a secret fortified community in the caves underneath the Amazon Rainforest. They build a crude research facility and continue developing their understanding of eSyrup. They establish underground farms to grow food for their community. 

Up in orbit, the resources of the space arboretums are stretched to their limit, as they try to sustain a population of nearly 60,000 refugees plus just over 12,000 "Original Orbiters". 

### 2080

The UN declares itself as the World Government. With military support from the Space Consortium, the World Government commandeers the former UN Green Havens that have survived The Global Water Crisis, which are now the only source of planetside agriculture. They force the people who have either remained in the Green Havens or have sought refuge in the Green Havens to farm for the World Government's agenda of meeting humanity's food needs, both planetside and in orbit. 

The **International Space Barge** Corps becomes a required "civil service" for all humans, but many Orbiters find loophoules out of doing their required service (often via medical reasons). ISB Corps servicehumes are required to accept certain standard-issue body mods, such as a forehead info-sphere and air filter-gills. 

The Space Barge fleet resumes its daily trips between planetside launch stations and the space arboretums. 

Upon hearing the news of the World Government, several members of Majhee's collective, including Majhee, co-write The Manifesto of the Automata. They pledge to remain free from oppressive rule by the World Government and to keep their eSyrup research a secret from the World Government. 
 
Eithne is born at Green Haven Hibernia. 

### 2082

Activist groups around the world protest the World Government's prioritisation of Orbiter food needs over planetside food needs. Some of these protests escalate into violence. This prompts the Space Consortium to reveal their fleet of orbiting missile-launching satellites, by sending a missile to **NAME OF CITY THAT GETS SPACE BOMBED**, a Green Haven that had been deemed unable to sustain itself against the ravages of the changing climate. 

With the orbit-based strategic advantage and military-grade firepower of the Space Consortium backing them, the World Government establishes absolute political power over the remaining planetside humans. 

Historians later come to call the years between 2076 and 2081 "The Global Water Crisis" and **THE GREAT SEPARATION**. Those left on Earth later came to call these years **THE BURNING OCEANS** and **"THE SEVERING"**. 

### 2083 

The Space Consortium begins construction on the **SPACE UNIVERSITY STATION** and accompanying **GEMINI ARBORETUM** (which would serve as **SPACE UNIVERSITY STATION**'s farm) to host the re-establishment of Space University. The construction project is huge and fully employs the refugee population on the 2 space arboretums, completely easing the strain on the space arboretums. However, even more laborers are needed for the construction, so nearly 200,000 Earthers from the ISB Corps are assigned to work up in orbit. 

Amadou's father is part of the first cohort of Earthers conscripted to go into orbit and work on the construction of **SPACE UNIVERSITY STATION** and **GEMINI ARBORETUM**. 

During this construction project, the Space Consortium organises incoming laborers according to categories of skilled and unskilled labour. Based on these distinctions, communities and loyalties grow and develop. 

### 2084

The Space Barge fleet increases to 114 vessels, allowing the Space Consortium to increase the Space Barge flight schedule from once daily to twice daily. 

Living conditions on the **SPACE UNIVERSITY STATION** construction site are not great, and lack of hygiene and medical facilities alone kills over 5,000 workers in the first year. The work environment is also dangerous, and numerous accidents happen while maneuvering in space - another 1,000 workers die in the first year from accidents in space. 

### 2085 

Amadou's father dies on the **SPACE UNIVERSITY STATION** construction site - his safety harness, being old and overused, malfunctions and he becomes detached. While floating away slowly from the construction site, he is fatally hit by a large piece of space debris. He is one of approximately 1,500 workers who die during this year of construction due to work accidents. 

Medical services still aren't great on the construction site, and fast-spreading flu-like disease runs through the population of unskilled laborers, who live in the worst conditions. A catastrophic 9,800 people die that year from health-related complications. 

A great many protests planetside have become violent during this year. More and more people try to run away from work conscription, and most of them are hunted down. More and more people begin to suspect malicious tracking and surveillance through body mods, and . 

The Space Welders guild, the first independently organised advocacy group on behalf of space laborers, registers itself under World Government law. They lobby for better working and living conditions on the **SPACE UNIVERSITY STATION** construction site. 

### 2086

By rumors and whispers, word spreads of the Automata, a secret collective hiding out in the Amazon Rainforest and living free from the oppression of the World Government. People from the underground cities wishing to avoid conscription to work in space try to run away and find the Automata, but most are all tracked down and brought back, brutally mutilated, to scare the Earthers into obedience. Those who escape the World Government's hunters more often than not die in the jungle. 

### 2087

The World Government lowers the minimum age for work conscription from 18 to 15. Amadou, now 15, is thrown out of Green Haven Santarém by his mother in an attempt to save him from death in space. Amadou, remembering the rumors about the Automata, survives in the rainforest while hunting for signs of the Automata. 

### 2088 

After a year of fruitless hunting, and almost giving up, Amadou trespasses on an Automata burial ground and runs into a mourning party. The Automata spare Amadou's life and spend a month learning about him and his ways. Afterwards, they deem him worthy and bring him back to the main clan. 

### 2089

Planetside population: still around 4 billion.

Orbiter population: nearly 100,000. 

### 2090

**SPACE UNIVERSITY STATION** and Gemini Arboretum are completed. Space University is flooded with applications from the many young adults whose educations were interrupted ever since planetside started to spiral into chaos around 2076. Competition for acceptance is fierce, and many are rejected. The wait list grows each year, as many of the rejected re-apply year after year.  

### 2091

Jina, who is now 21 and has been helping Majhee research eSyrup, discovers how to use eSyrup to build an ansible receiver, allowing the Automata to intercept interstellar communications by the Space Consortium and World Government. Amadou, now 19 and proving himself to be a math prodigy, helps Jina develop an algorithm for decrypting the messages sent between planetside, orbital, and Mars-based operations. 

### 2098

Construction begins to convert Gemini Arboretum into the Gemini Youth Station, which will serve as home to the **International Space Exploration Corps**. Similar to the International Space Barge Corps, the ISE Corps establishes a pre-university training program for Orbiter youth, meant to prepare them for future work in space exploration and/or further education at Space University. 

### 2099

Jheri is born. 

Orbiter population: 250,000.

### 2101

Eithne travels to Green Haven Kentucky to work as a plant splicer, meaning she takes environmental monitoring data and uses it to genetically engineer plants to be robust to the extreme conditions on the surface. 

Zalo is born. 

Tross is born. 


### 2102

Oana is born. 

### 2103

Asoka is born at Green Haven Kentucky. 

Rajue is born. 

### 2104 

Orbiter population reaches 500,000. 

Construction on the Gemini Youth Station is completed, and the International Space Exploration Corps welcomes its first class of students. The ISE Corps is a year-round pre-university-level training institute for the career class "Interplanetary Travel and Communications". Anyone between the ages of 15 and 18 may apply to attend, and several specialization fields are taught, to be noted on the final certification as an "ISS Corps apprentice-level certification in Interplanetary Travel and Communications, with specializations in ...". Students who excel are recommended for Space University, which gives them a competitive edge in the application process.

Min is born. Rhee is born. 

### 2105

Eithne realises that a faction in the World Gov and the Space Consortium is secretly using the Green Havens to develop genetically engineered food plants with genes that hijack the body into making nano-scale bio-data sensors, which can collect biochemical data from within the body and then wirelessly transmit that data to a remote database. Unable to decide who to trust and afraid to endanger young Asoka, she and João decide not to expose the plot and instead, Eithne works to sabotage the experiments. 

### 2110

Eithne is caught sabotaging plant splicing experiments and is arrested. João and Asoka flee Green Haven Kentucky. 

### 2112

After 2 years of hiding in the Northern Underground Cities, trying to evade mercenaries sent to hunt them down, João and Asoka are forced to cross the **RED ZONE** into the Southern Hemisphere. They are found by Amadou and brought to the Automata. Not knowing who to trust, João makes no mention of why they left Green Haven Kentucky, and begs for sanctuary with the Automata for the sake of 6-year-old Asoka. The Automata decide to let them stay as long as they renounce the use of any Orbiter products and never speak of the Underground Cities. 

### 2113

Climate change and wars on Earth are still creating refugee populations everywhere on Earth. The Space Consortium convinces the World Government to implement a refugee re-education process that gives Earther refugees the option of joining the ISE Corps as scholarship students, in which their application and tuition fees are waived in exchange for working on the Gemini Arboretum farm and on service crews at Gemini Youth Station during their apprentice-level training. This program, called the **Space Asylum Program**, is seen as a politically suave move and great PR. The Space Asylum Program is advertised as an effort to increase the diversity of the ISE Corps student body and increase the appeal of the ISE Corps mission as a global endeavor. Critics see it as just another flavour of exploitation and social oppression.

### 2116

Jina falls terribly ill, and nothing the Automata do seems to help. João reveals that he has been using a World Gov medical scanner and portable Laser Atomic Manipulator (LAM) to monitor his and Asoka's health and see to their medical needs. They offer both devices to the Automata as a means of saving Jina, revealing their breach of Automata law. 

João also decides to tell the Automata about the circumstances surrounding their departure from Green Haven Kentucky. After much discussion, the Automata accept their offer to help Jina recover from her illness, but Majhee, fearful for the safety of the Automata if they were to be caught harboring fugitives wanted by the World Government and the Space Consortium, asks João and Asoka to leave. 

Min and Asoka, who have become close friends during the Moreiras' 4 year stay with the Automata, secretly keep in touch. 

### 2118

Min completes her training as an arborist and receives her subdermal shield, in a ritual ceremony where expert artists and crafters of the Automata are injected with raw eSyrup. She applies to the Space Asylum Program. 

### 2119 

Min and Asoka arrive at the ISE Corps.
