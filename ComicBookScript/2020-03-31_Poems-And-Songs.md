# Poems and songs for the world after The Burning

# "Spin the needle"
Spin the needle, spin the thread,
keep the sunlight off your head,
wind will sting and water burns,
everybody takes a turn!

Spin the needle, spin the thread,
catch the sunlight, make it bread,
plant the seed and sand the worms,
everybody takes a turn!

Spin the needle, spin the thread,
home is where I make my bed,
Mecca, mecha, live and learn,
everybody takes a turn!

# "Mother, Mother, where are you?"

Mother, Mother, 
where are you?
In my nose (in my nose) and in my toes (and in my toes),
then all the skin (all the skin) to my fingertips (fingertips),
eyelids (eyelids), ears (ears), and both my lips.

Mother, Mother, 
how do you move?
To the left and to the right,



# "Mama Bird"
Lost the sky, lost the sea,
lost the air we need to breathe,
ate until we lost our teeth,
and carried on beyond our means,
thinking we no longer need
the very Earth beneath our feet.

Mama Bird, 





We found the caves to keep us cool,
a Sanctuary for our seeds,
the fresh and hidden water pools,
and now we weave, and now we weave.
