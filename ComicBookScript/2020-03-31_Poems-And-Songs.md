# Poems and songs for the world after The Burning

# "Spin the needle"
Spin the needle, spin the thread,
keep the sunlight off your head,
wind will sting and water burns,
everybody takes a turn!

Spin the needle, spin the thread,
keep the sunlight off your bed, 
grass for people, sand for worms,
everybody takes a turn!

Spin the needle, spin the thread,
catch the sunlight, make it bread,
Mecca, mecca, live and learn,
everybody takes a turn!
