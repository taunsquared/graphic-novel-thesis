Calling all visual artists, comic book illustrators, technical drawers, and scientific illustrators! 

The VIRS (or Vigilante Intergalactic Roustabout Scholars) project is seeking to hire visual artists and technical drawers to illustrate a neuroscience PhD thesis, currently titled "How the assumptions we make about brains affect our interactions and our societies". Part 1 of this thesis will be a graphic novel, currently titled "The First VIRS". 

Plot teaser for the graphic novel: 
It is the year 2119. 17-year-old Min has reached one of the highest distinctions normally given to the Earth-bound Automata - certification as a Master Arborist and Tree Surfer, an expert in caring for and harvesting varieties of Giant Hardwood Trees destined to travel into space as the furniture, flooring, and walls of Orbiters' home pods. But Min wants more. She wants to go into space herself, not just send up products of comfort and convenience to the Orbiters, in lumbering Space Barges that burn painfully through the sky every sunrise and sunset to reach the bustling network of space stations, homes, and transport craft that circle the Earth. Min dreams of freedom from the over-used and abused planet Earth, whose water and air are now too poisonous for human consumption, whose atmosphere can no longer protect humans from the cancerous radiations of the Sun. But this dream is unattainable for the Automata, unless they can earn an apprenticeship at the International Space Exploration Corps, a training institute for Earthers and Orbiters interested in career class "Interplanetary Travel and Communications". The application process is rigorous and competitive, and very few Automata have ever gained acceptance at the ISE Corps. Min, armed with a sharp mind, fierce friends, and a family heritage of resilience and endurance, is determined to be one of these very few. 

Roles and responsibilities of illustrators
We are looking for 3 types of illustrators:
 - chapter illustrators, who will create the visual storytelling component of each chapter of the graphic novel; 
 - concept artists, whose work will be used as part of the design and layout of each chapter title page; and
 - scientific illustrators, who will create technical diagrams to supplement the graphic novel story and accompany the rest of the thesis. 

Each chapter illustrator will be responsible for co-creating, with script author Danbee Kim, one 12-page chapter of the graphic novel "The First VIRS". This process will involve: 
 - iteratively discussing and designing the visual look and feel of the characters;
 - iteratively discussing and designing the visual look and feel of the story world, which is futuristic, dystopic, and inspiring;
 - iteratively discussing and designing the visual look and feel of the main character Min's favorite childhood story, "An Illustrated Primer for Neuroscience", which will feature heavily in the graphic novel plot. These drawings will need to be a hybrid of storybook illustration and technical scientific diagram;
 - producing 12 pages, each page in both analog and digital formats, of illustrated script, with major feedback and revisions at 3 stages: storyboard, inked drawings, and coloured pages with typeset script. 
 
Each concept artist will be responsible for co-creating, with script author Danbee Kim, one piece of concept art that will serve as a chapter title page for the graphic novel "The First VIRS". This process will involve: 
 - iteratively discussing and designing the visual look and feel of the chapter as a whole, and as part of the graphic novel story arc;
 - iteratively discussing and designing the textual elements of the chapter title page;
 - producing a single, full-page piece of concept art, in both analog and digital formats, that serves as a chapter title page, with major feedback and revision at 3 stages: sketches, inked drawing, and coloured page with typeset chapter title and other textual elements. 
 
Each scientific illustrator will be responsible for co-creating, with script author Danbee Kim, one full-page scientific diagram that will complement the story of the graphic novel "The First VIRS". This process will involve: 
 - iteratively discussing the scientific concepts which will be conveyed by each diagram and how it fits into the thesis as a whole;
 - iteratively discussing and designing the visual look and feel that best conveys the scientific content of the thesis within the context of a graphic novel story;
 - producing a single, full-page scientific diagram, in both analog and digital formats, that serves as supplementary technical and scientific figures, with major feedback and revisions at 3 stages: sketches, inked drawing, and coloured page with typeset textual elements. 
 
Payment
Illustrators will be paid on a "by page" basis, meaning they will be paid once a completed page of artwork has been submitted to script author Danbee Kim. Pages will be considered complete based on the expectations and criteria discussed with the script author during to the process described above. 
Chapter illustrators will be paid
 - 40 GBP per page of finalized character design (number of character designs to be discussed with script author); 
 - 40 GBP per inked page of their chapter; and 
 - 40 GBP per final coloured page of their chapter. 
Concept artists will be paid
 - 40 GBP per inked drawing of the chapter title page; and
 - 40 GBP per final coloured chapter title page.
Scientific Illustrators will be paid
 - 40 GBP per inked drawing of full-page scientific and/or technical diagram; and
 - 40 GBP per final coloured full-page scientific and/or technical diagram. 
 
To Apply
 - Chapter Illustrators: please submit a character sketch of Min in her daily life as an arborist in the year 2119, and diagram of a nervous system cell (neuron or glia) in children's storybook style.  
 - Concept Artists: please submit a full-page concept drawing based on the plot teaser above. 
 - Scientific Illustrators: please submit a technical drawing or scientific diagram of a neuroscience topic of your choice. Your drawing must be labeled and captioned using language accessible to readers between the ages of 8 to 18 years old. 

Please send all submissions to danbee [at] alum.mit.edu, with subject line "Illustrating for The First VIRS". Artists will retain full ownership of any artwork submitted as part of their application(s) to work on this project, and no payment will be given for artwork submitted during the application process. Artists may apply for multiple roles within this project. 
Deadline for submissions: August 31, 2018. 
Successful applicants will be contacted by September 4, 2018.
