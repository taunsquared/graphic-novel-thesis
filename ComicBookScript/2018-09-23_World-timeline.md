# World timeline

### 2040

Education is still in crisis, cities are overcrowded, and rural communities are dying. Severe drought for the last 10 years has devastated agricultural productivity around the world. Environmentally destructive industrial practices continue to push planetary ecosystems to dangerous extremes. 

The International Space Elevator Consortium (ISEC) successfully deploys their first space elevator and announces initial operations for their first “Galactic Harbour”, a transportation infrastructure that enables a full transition from planetside to low, medium, geostationary, and high Earth orbit.

A group of researchers working on genetically engineered yeast for monitoring female reproductive health accidentally culture a mutant strain of yeast, which eats its glass vial and turns into a slug-worm-shaped mass. After a few hours in isolation, it melts into a puddle of dead yeast cells. The researchers made note of the process that produced this yeast mutant in an open-access report on "failed" genetically engineered yeast biofactories. 

### 2043

Majhee, a young PhD student in organometallic chemistry, discovers the report on "failed" genetically engineered yeast biofactories while working on a project trying to build low-cost biologically sensitive field-effect transistors (bioFETs) for mass-produced breathing masks. Majhee replicated the most promising procedures from the report, including the mutant strain that ate its glass vial. Majhee was able to recreate the slug-worm-shaped mass, containing it in a tub made of silica-free plastic. Fascinated by the bacterial culture, Majhee carefully feeds and observes the culture, and eventually realises that the bacterial superorganism can "spin" thread-like mycelium structures that generate spontaneous bursts of electrical activity that move like waves down the length of the thread. Her entire PhD thesis is now focused on the yeast mutant, now called "electrophoretic mycelium yeast", or "thread-worms". 

### 2044

The ISEC announces successful completion of initial operations for their first Galactic Harbour. Global enthusiasm for the commercial and industrial value of Galactic Harbours leads to the establishment of the Space Consortium (SC), a collection of individuals, organizations, and governments dedicated to scalable, inexpensive, and reliable access to space. 

### 2046

Majhee defends her PhD thesis, "Cultivating electrophoretic mycelium yeast to fabricate living organic semiconductors".

The ISEC announces successful completion of initial operations for their second Galactic Harbour. 

### 2047

Majhee is now a post-doc researcher at Laboratório Nacional de Biociências e Saúde Pública (LNBSP) refining the process of cultivating thread-worms to optimize their production of electrophoretic mycelium, dubbed "Synaptic Thread" or "SynTh". She and her colleagues develop methods for mass producing and harvesting SynTh in order to fabricate low-cost bacterial field-effect transistors, or BactoFETs, which can be used as biosensors and bio-compatible electronics. A growing worldwide network of citizen scientists and open science activists coalesce into an online DIY SynTh enthusiasts forum, called the Open SynTh Exchange (OSE). Through these networks of collaborators, Majhee and colleagues are able to rapidly publish advances in SynTh science and technology as open source and freely-accessible academic work.

SC presents the United Nations with a proposal to build orbiting farms in collaboration with the UN Green Havens, areas of the world set aside to preserve Earth's agricultural traditions and provide biodiversity sanctuaries. Together they would conduct research into exo-hydroponics (plants useful for space travel) and permaculture in low gravity. SC also offers to help fight the global food shortage with food grown in space, and pledges to dedicate a set percentage of the carrying capacity of each space elevator to the transport of resources back and forth between orbiting farms and planetside. The UN grants them a 10-year research and development grant.

### 2050

Majhee and her colleagues present a proposal to the United Nations to develop affordable and sustainable bactoFET air/water filters and SynTh textiles to protect humans from the increasingly polluted environment. Majhee and colleagues plan to distribute seed cultures of thread-worms in communities where they've trained people to cultivate the yeast mutants. Because the thread-worms require only water and silica for food, these communities should be able to sustain the thread-worms with silica from local sand, rocks, recycled glass, and even certain plants. Majhee and her colleagues are awarded a 10-year world health development grant, which earns Majhee a position as research group leader at the LNBSP. 

### 2051

SC's first orbiting farm, **THE PEGGY WHITSON MEMORIAL SPACE ARBORETUM**, is completed. 

### 2053

SC reports the first successful harvest of crops grown in low gravity, more than enough to feed the crew aboard **THE PEGGY WHITSON MEMORIAL SPACE ARBORETUM**. They distribute their first excess yield of orbit-grown crops to planetside countries in need.

### 2054

Majhee and her collaborators have set up over 200 "thread-worm nursuries" in communities around the world where air and water pollution levels have been deemed above critical levels. These nursuries allow Majhee and her collaborators to begin mass manufacturing bactoFET air/water filters and sun-safe textiles, which they then distribute with the help of the World Health Organization and Doctor's Without Borders. 

The LNBSP is approached by SC, who are interested in thread-worm research and are looking to collaborate. Based on the rapidly growing collection of studies on thread-worms, SC believes that it may be possible to process SynTh into an energy-dense and super-efficient battery. SC offers to provide full funding for the collaboration, on the condition that any research activity directly generated by the collaboration cannot be discussed on the Open SynTh Exchange. The President of the LNBSP agrees to the collaboration, despite many concerns and protests amongst the faculty and staff of the LNBSP and amongst members of the OSE. 

### 2057

The LNBSP publishes their first successful surgical implantation in mice of a medical device made with bactoFETs, which monitors for the presence of cancerous cells in the skin. Just a few months later, SC submits an exclusive patent for a very similar bactoFET medical device for humans even before initiating human trials on their device design, sparking criticism from members of the LNBSP and human rights activists. 

### 2058

SC begins to mass-manufacture commercial SynTh products, using bactoFET chips to create tiny implantable organic electronics that can replace all of the functionality of "smart mobile phones" that were commonplace during the early 21st century. 

### 2059

Majhee, her lab, and other collaborators on the OSE begin experimenting with splicing SynTh directly into skin cells from several species, including mice and humans. Majhee and her lab at the LNBSP submit a proposal to develop SynTh-hybrid skin, a self-cleaning and self-mending fabric that can grow with a human throughout one's whole life, to be used to make clothing for refugees and the poverty-stricken. They win a 10-year technology innovation grant from the UN. 

SC announces that full operations capability at both Galactic Harbours, and begins transporting humans into space with their fleet of space elevators, colloquially called the Space Ferries. 

### 2060

While conducting their own research on more efficient ways to integrate SynTh onto textiles, Iúna Morei, a volunteer for the World Health Organization and the owner of several textile manufacturing plants, and her collaborators discover that SynTh can provide alternative means for long-distance, wireless communication when woven into a large enough textile surface. They post their findings on the OSE, where the idea initially sparks enthusiasm but dies out due to the difficulties of manifesting long-distance wireless communication in hybrid SynTh materials any smaller than an average human adult's torso. 

SC launches the first orbiting private home pod from the **PEGGY WHITSON MEMORIAL SPACE ARBORETUM**. Within months, nearly 200 additional home pods are funded and launched. 

SC completes construction on their second Orbital farm, the **ANNIE EASELY MEMORIAL ARBORETUM**. 

### 2062

Implantable SynTh body modifications are increasingly common, now that tiny implantable organic electronics have completely replaced hand-held "smartphones" as the ubiquitous everyday computing technology. "Vanity mods" become a favorite trend of young people, while certain industries begin providing their employees with company-subsidized occupationally-specific body implants. New industries also develop around the extended capacities of workers with more practical implants. 

In response to this trend, Iúna and other activists concerned with the human rights implications of SynTh mods quietly begin to investigate the potential for SynTh mods to lead to direct biological data harvesting, malicious bio-hacking, and oppressive surveillance. This leads them to establish the Biononymous, a philosophical movement that rejects the use of body mods and surgical SynTh implants. They develop a secret textile research program to create SynTh clothing that will not only protect wearers from harmful solar radiations and polluted air, but will also prevent any wireless transmissions from entering or exiting their bodies or clothing, and will obscure their presence on surveillance recordings. They integrate their discoveries from 2 years ago to enable secure long-distance communications with other members of the Biononymous. The Biononymous movement becomes particularly popular at the UN Green Havens.

### 2064

Majhee and colleagues struggle to create SynTh-hybrid skin, but acheive a SynTh-hybrid textile that can change color or texture based on the application of certain electromagnetic frequencies. 

SC and the LNBSP develop SynTh batteries, which can provide rechargable portable power equivalent to a conventional battery at least 20 times larger by volume. SC demands that they be allowed to have proprietary access and rights to these SynTh products for at least 25 years. This sparks rigorous protests throughout the scientific community, and the LNBSP refuses to agree. SC takes legal action, and is wins exclusive rights to the SynTh battery intellectual property. 

### 2065

Iúna Morei gives birth to João Morei in Randolph Center, Vermont, USA.

SynTh clothing, based on the SynTh-hybrid textile material published by Majhee the previous year, makes an explosively successful entrance on the scenes of luxury clothing labels and technical outdoor gear. 

### 2066

The SC completes **MAE JEMISON MEMORIAL ARBORETUM**, their third orbiting arboretum and first space station built entirely in orbit (but still using raw resources refined planetside). Orbiter population reaches 8,063. 

Majhee and her colleagues successfully create the first biofilm made from thread-worm spliced with the cyanobacteria *Anabaena*. 

### 2067: The Global Water Crisis, or, **THE BURNING**

A deep-sea silica harvesting rig in the Antarctic Convergence accidentally vents deep-sea volcanic plumes, full of [silicon tetrafluoride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_tetrafluoride), directly into the air above the ocean from a leak just below the surface. This creates a huge cloud of hydrogen flouride and transforms the surrounding ocean into a deadly sea of hydroflouric acid. The poisonous cloud blinds the rig's crew, and the hydroflouric acid boils anyone who falls into the ocean, so the deep-sea volcanic plumes belch unchecked into the Antarctic Convergence. Ocean currents spread the hydroflouric acid into the Indian Ocean Gyre, the Southern Pacific Gyre, and the Southern Atlantic Gyre, destroying ecosystems and utterly disrupting the water cycle on the planet. The enormous cloud of hydrogen flouride is picked up by global wind currents and spreads throughout the atmosphere. Panic leads to military action, riots, and an incredible death toll. 

Meanwhile, in São Paulo, Majhee and her colleagues have just successfully spliced thread-worm with eukaryotic cell cultures for the first time, and now they are witnessing the birth of the first thread-worm-spliced mammal, a rat-like creature named Nimh. Nimh lives 11 days. Nimh dies on the day that the news of the deep-sea silica harvesting rig disaster reaches the LNBSP. Majhee and her colleagues pack up all of their raw thread-worm cultures and research and flee with their families inland. They hide with friends and family in caves deep under the Amazon Rainforest. 

Iúna flees with her son João into caves in Vermont to escape the huge clouds of hydrogen flouride.

Massive fluctuations of electromagnetic radiation from sun flares completely disrupt planetside digital computing technology infrastructures. The vast majority of servers worldwide are wiped clean, and power grids go down. 

Amid the chaos, nearly 60,000 planetside humans swarm onto Space Ferries to flee into orbit. The Space Ferries are overcrowded and the SC fears that too many people will try to come up into orbit and overload their resources, so they decide that, after one last trip, the Space Ferries would remain docked at the Orbital stations and not return to planetside until planetside has stabilized. 

### 2068, or Year 1 "After Burning" (A.B.)

The Earth's surface environment continues to spiral into drought, extreme weather, and hyper-salination of surface fresh water sources. Those still surviving on the planet, numbering around 4 billion, have taken refuge in caves all over the world, seeking respite from the sun and searching for aquafirs of clean water deep underground. Humans become nocturnal, coming above ground only at night, if at all, and learn to survive underground. 

Majhee and her collective of 67 humans establish a secret fortified community in the caves underneath the Amazon Rainforest. They build a crude research facility and continue developing their understanding of thread-worms. They establish underground farms to grow food for their community. 

Up in orbit, the resources of the space arboretums are stretched to their limit, as they try to sustain a population of nearly 60,000 refugees plus just over 12,000 "Original Orbiters", or "Originals". The UN and SC have collaboratively set up a provisional government in orbit, and rush to install crowded, barely adequate housing for the refugees in the larger stations and industrial structures in orbit. 

### 2072, or Year 4 A.B.

A terrible and mysterious illness spreads throughout the orbiting population, killing over 10,000 orbiters in the first year. The illness becomes known as the Space Plague of Year 4. 

### 2075, or Year 7 A.B.

A vaccine for the terrible and mysterious illness is finally developed and deployed. In the end, the space plague kills 19,842 refugees and 4,507 Originals, leaving behind a total orbiter population of just over 47,500. 

### 2083, or Year 15 A.B.

In the 15 years since the Burning, the refugees from Earth have become the working class of the Orbiters. The hastily built housing structures from over a decade ago, meant to be improved or replaced, have become overgrown slums. Some refugees now call themselves "the Exiles", and dream of returning to Earth to reclaim it as their own. Some seek to assimilate into proper Orbiter society, to change their status from "Podless" (equivalent to homeless) and gain the dignity and luxury of the "Originals". 

As the chaos of the Burning slowly subsides and planetside atmospheric conditions stabilize, the provisional Orbiter government begins to send Space Ferries staffed with military personnel and drafted refugee "volunteers" down to the surface in order to harvest raw inorganic materials for the Orbiter needs. They limit their activities to latitudes close to the poles, as conditions in the equatorial regions of the planet (referred to as the Red Zone) are still overwhelmingly hot, acidic, and chaotic. The refugee workers are forced to act as "canaries", testing out newly developed environmental hazmat suits and being the first onto any mining site. Over 2,000 refugees die on these mining missions in just the first year. In the wake of these tragic missions, the refugee population in orbit begins to organize, protest, and riot. The provisional Orbiter government responds with brutal force, and these events become known as the Riots of Year 12. 

### 2087, or Year 19 A.B.

A planetside harvesting mission discovers the fledging surface farm of a cave city in the upper latitudes of North America, and the provisional Orbiter government realise that there are surviving Earthers -- not just a few, but networks of underground cities. At first the provisional Orbiter government tries to suppress this information, but the news spreads like wildfire amongst the Podless, and the refugee Orbiters become even more difficult to control. The provisional Orbiter government declares itself to be the "World Government", harshly suppresses the refugees in orbit, and send military delegations to seize control of the surviving Earthers and their underground cities, which they assume are limited to areas outside the Red Zone. However, the Earthers are more organized and advanced in their recovery than expected, largely thanks to the religious cult the Biononymous. The World Government is forced to sign a treaty of shared planetside governance with the leaders of the Biononymous in exchange for the science, tech, and insights of the Biononymous which allow them to grow food and emerge safely onto the planet's surface. 

Upon hearing the news of the World Government, several members of Majhee's collective, including Majhee, co-write The Manifesto of the Automata. They pledge to remain free from oppressive rule by the World Government and to keep their thread-worm research a secret from the World Government. 

### 2089, or Year 21 A.B. 

The SC begins construction on the **SPACE UNIVERSITY STATION** and accompanying **GEMINI ARBORETUM** (which would serve as **SPACE UNIVERSITY STATION**'s farm) to host the re-establishment of Space University. The construction project is huge and employs the vast majority of the refugee population in orbit, massively easing the strain on the existing space arboretums. However, living conditions on the **SPACE UNIVERSITY STATION** construction site are not great, and lack of hygiene and medical facilities alone kills over 1,000 workers in the first year. The work environment is also dangerous, and numerous accidents happen while maneuvering in space - another 1,000 workers die in the first year from accidents in space. 

The Space Ferries fleet increases to 114 vessels. The fleet's primary function continues to be the mining missions that go planetside in order to harvest raw construction material, now with the begrudging collaboration of the Biononymous and the Underground Cities. 

The Exiled are now more organised, taking on a religious flavour, emboldened by the news that Earthers have survived the Burning. Most Exiles want to sneak back to planetside and disappear into the Underground Cities; a few harbour grand delusions of overthrowing the Biononymous, whom they regard as their planetside rivals, in order to rule the new Earther society. 

### 2092, or Year 24 A.B.

Exiles from orbit have now established ways of joining the planetside mining missions, then smuggling themselves out of planetside military complexes and into the safety of the Underground Cities. A small, secret faction of the Biononymous and citizens from the Underground Cities have created a network of safe houses and agents who help orbiter refugees escape, and in many cases, reunite with family from whom they were separated during the Burning. This network becomes known as the Underground Railroad. The escaped refugees are officially recorded as dead or missing. 

Construction on **SPACE UNIVERSITY STATION** is completed. 

The Space Ferries fleet resumes regular trips between planetside launch stations and the orbiter stations, operating at an average of one trip every 3 months. 

### 2094, or Year 26 A.B. 

Space University holds welcomes its first cohort of students, ranging in age from 18 to 55. Most are Originals, a tiny fraction are Podless.  

The official Orbiter population (both refugee and original) is now just over 39,000. The success of the Underground Railroad has spawned a network of smugglers, primarily identifying as Exiles, with a variety of goals and intentions, all developing connections between Earthers and Orbiters. An ecosystem of illegal trade and travel between Earth and Orbit develops thanks to this network. 

### 2098, or Year 30 A.B. (1st year of The Confinement)

Space University establishes the **International Space Exploration Corps** in order to train younger humans in developing and maintaining the skills and knowledge necessary for space exploration. ISE Corps trainees spend an average of 3 years studying space travel and communications while helping maintain the Space Ferries that can carry humans, equipment, and other resources back and forth between the space arboretums and planetside. The ISE Corps is a year-round pre-university training institution that prepares youth for Space University. Its' first cohort of students is entirely made up of Originals. 

A group of ambitious and powerful smugglers called the Pirate Lords kidnap a Space University professor who had been conducting unethical experiments on SynTh splicing using imprisoned Exiles caught conducting illegal smuggling activity between Earth and Orbit. The Pirate Lords post a ransom for the prof, and demand justice and reparation for the Exiles. The World Government responds with military violence, aggressively searching for the kidnapped professor and declaring martial law upon "the entirety of the Human sphere of influence, both on Earth and in orbit." The World Government imposes a food and minerals tithe from Earthers, requiring all Underground Cities and Green Havens to deliver 20 percent of their yearly yield of crops and mineral resources to their resident Peacekeepers, who are supposedly protecting the Earthers from "terrorists" (aka the Exiles). 

Activist groups around the world protest the World Government's prioritisation of Orbiter food needs over planetside food needs, the aggressive punitive attitude towards the Exiles, and the harsh austerity of The Confinement. The World Government declares that anyone found to be cooperating with the Exiles would be arrested and tried for aiding and abetting terrorists. 

### 2102, or Year 34 A.B. (4th year of The Confinement)

One year of work as service staff with the **International Space Exploration Corps** becomes a required "civil service" for all Orbiters, but many Originals find loopholes out of doing their required service (often via medical reasons). ISE Corps servicehumes are required to accept certain standard-issue body mods, such as a forehead info-sphere and air filter-gills. The ISE also begins a scholarship program to get more Podless into the ISE as students.  

Thanks to the increased resources available to the World Government, the Space Ferries begin operating once a month. 

### 2103, or Year 35 A.B. (5th year of The Confinement)

The World Government captures the Pirate Lords (and the Space Uni professor), and all are tried in court. The Space Uni professor is fined but allowed to return to her post at Space Uni. The Pirate Lords are found guilty of terrorism and publicly executes them. This causes a major outcry from activists both on Earth and in Orbit, and protests escalate from more or less non-violent to very violent. 

### 2105, or Year 37 A.B. (7th and Final year of The Confinement)

The World Government and the Exiles reach a truce after 2 years of violent conflict. The World Government grants the Underground Cities self-governance and completely removes all Peacekeeper presence from all Biononymous Havens. Exiles are granted the freedom of movement between Earth and Orbit. The yearly tithe from the Underground Cities and the Havens to Orbiters is reduced to 10 percent. The Biononymous agree to an exclusive reveal of their advances in SynTh reserach thus far to the World Government, and to contribute a yearly quota of personnel and expertise to SynTh research conducted by the World Government. 

The recently newly elected Secretary-General of the WG decides that it's time to declare the end of Confinement and grants Earthers the "freedom to surface" as a gesture of good will -- practically, however, the unequal distribution of resources and education means that in the vast majority of cases only the Biononymous have the means to safely leave the Underground Cities as they choose. Also, the WG requires everyone who wishes to accept the "freedom to surface" to register and set up automatic feedback from their surface gear to quality control centres run by the WG. 

### 2112, or Year 44 A.B. 

The Space Ferries now operate once every week. 

### 2116, or Year 48 A.B.
