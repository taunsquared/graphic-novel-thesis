**NAMES IN BOLD AND ALL CAPS ARE PLACEHOLDERS**

*"Dialogue in italics are thoughts of characters."*

**"*Dialogue in italics and bold are spoken by the Biononymous while wearing the uniforms of their cult, which layers audio effects on their voices such that they cannot be identified by the sound of their speech.*"**

**"Dialogue in bold is without an associated character is narrative text or sound effects, not spoken by any character."**

This script will be published as a "companion booklet" to the graphic novel, for those interested in taking a deeper dive into the science that inspired various aspects of the story.

## Chapter 1: Calm Before the Storm

Character designs: Majhee Suh, Iúna Morei, Kai Oliveira, Beatriz Cavalcanti, Nova Jatobá, Vec Barbosa

### Chapter Title Page

**"Loading Universal Record..."**

**"Finished loading...'The Space Consortium Fights World Hunger'; [Classification: *Unclassified*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information#Typical_classification_levels)."**

**"In 2054, Space Consortium presented the United Nations with a proposal to collaborate with the Green Havens (biodiversity sanctuaries around the world that preserve Earth's agricultural traditions) in order to conduct research into exo-hydroponics (plants useful for space travel) and permaculture in low gravity. Space Consortium offered to use this research to help fight the global food shortage with food grown in space, and pledged half of the carrying capacity of its recently completed space elevator project, The Shuttle Barges, to guarantee reliable transport of resources back and forth between orbiting farms and planetside. Thus, Space Consortium played a major role in improving the quality of life on Earth before The Burning..."**

### Page 1

**"2066: Mae Jemison Memorial Arboretum"**

**"It was a day of hope and wonder."** 

**"The Space Consortium had just completed their third space farm, and the news feeds were drowning in videos of the glamorous ribbon-cutting event..."**

We see beautiful, important people draped in gorgeously fashionable and unspeakably expensive formal attire, eSyrup fabric programmed to fluidly change colours in response to the lights, the music, and their wearers' moods.

**"...of the Orbiter home pods that synchronised their velocities with the new arboretum..."**

In the viewing port of the Arboretum, we see a huge mass of gathered Orbiter home pods, floating in synchronised orbit next to the Arboretum.

**"...of delicate, mouth-watering hors d'oeuvres made from succulent crops grown at the two older space farms, in carefully filtered water and pristine soil..."**

**"...for the world was becoming too dirty, too extreme in its weather, to support industrial planetside farming..."**

**"...and many people, on this historic day, were starving..."**

### Page 2

**"São Paulo, Brazil"**

We see Majhee walking briskly through the crowded streets of São Paulo. Everyone is wearing what looks like light-weight full-body hazmat suits, flickering a bit as the eSyrup in the material absorbs dangerous radiation in the air. All hoods are up, breathing masks and googles are on. The air is hazy with smog, the sky a smeared grey-blue, and the mid-morning sun pale. As Majhee passes shops and cafes, the daily news appears in hologram-like projections that occupy the ceilings or hover at standing-head-height. Other humans have tiny projections coming from subdermally implanted chips in their wrists, palms, ears, or foreheads; these projections surround their wrists, palms, ears, or face with a sphere of light, either sonifying or visualising entertainment, memories, mental models, dreams, news, and scholarly publications. 

A lot of the news is about the new space arboretum, but a few mention the new research base recently established on Mars. Most of the individual **INFO-SPHERE**s are focused on news about planetside climate disasters: 
* [The Colorado River has dried up completely](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/the-colorado-river-runs-dry-61427169/) and the severe drought is causing mass migrations to the east, causing massive overcrowding in major inland ("mid-western US") cities.
* Last year's [total evaporation of the River Niger](https://www.vanguardngr.com/2016/05/river-niger-drying-fg-raises-alarm/) has led to massive lootings at yet another hydropower station.
* An extremely aggressive water-borne disease has wiped out several major urban areas in [India](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1151007/) 
* In the past 10 years, illnesses from sun radiation, such as skin cancer, have had a [hundred-fold jump in rate of diagnosis](http://www.who.int/uv/faq/skincancer/en/index1.html) around the world.

We see Majhee walk past a large research facility, metal and glass architecture dully gleaming in the smoggy light, labeled "Laboratório Nacional de Biociências e Saúde Pública". 

*translation: National Laboratory for Biosciences and Public Health*

The front of the research facility is teeming with protesters. Majhee sneaks into an alleyway to enter the research facility via a back door. 

### Page 3

Inside the research institute, we see a receptionist sitting behind a sealed glass window. Next to him is a decontamination chamber that all must pass thru in order to enter the research facility. 

Receptionist: **"Dr. Suh! Quão ruim é isso lá fora?"**

*translation: "Dr. Suh! How bad is it out there?"**

Majhee takes off her hood and googles - she is pretty and youthful for her 37 years, if it weren't for the many lines of worry and grim determination on her face. She shakes out her hair, cropped short in a bowl pixie cut. Clearly having many troubling thoughts, she begins taking off her eSyrup hazmat suit.  

Majhee: **"Ainda lotado."**

*translation: "Still crowded."*

Receptionist: **"Idiotas. Eles não entendem que estamos tentando ajudar?"**

*translation: "Idiots. Don't they understand we're trying to help?"*

Majhee: **"Bem, eles estão com fome. Não consigo pensar quando você está com fome."**

*translation: "Well, they're hungry. Can't think when you're hungry."*

Majhee removes her boots and steps into the decontamination chamber.

### Page 4

Majhee stands in her office, seemingly floating in the center of a giant transparent bacteria made of light. The light model of the bacteria is exquisitely detailed, and a section of the nucleoid is blown up for closer inspection. Majhee's fingers are raised in a well-practiced yet complicated gesture. Her face is darkened with barely contained rage. 

Off panel: **"Majhee, você não pode *colher* o *Space Consortium*..."**

*translation: "Majhee, you can't *scoop* the *Space Consortium*..."*

Majhee: **"Pela última vez, Márcia, tudo é livremente acessível!"**

*translation: "For the last time, Marcia, it's all freely accessible!"*

We see Marcia Netto, Director of the Laboratório Nacional de Biociências e Saúde Pública, in Majhee's doorway, rubbing her forehead with exasperation.

Marcia: **"Eles estão *determinados* a ganhar dinheiro com os aplicativos da eSyrup, e a licença Creative Commons torna seu trabalho *não patenteável*!"**

*translation: "They are **determined** to make money off eSyrup applications, and the Creative Commons license makes your work **unpatentable**!"*

Majhee: **"Exactamente."**

*translation: "Exactly."*

Marcia: **"Mas você viu o que eles fizeram depois da nossa colaboração para combustível eSyrup!"**

*translation: "But you saw what they did after our eSyrup fuel collaboration!"*

### Page 5

Majhee angrily turns off the giant bacteria of light with an impatient gesture as she turns to Marcia, furious.

Majhee: **"*Você* empurrou essa colaboração, contra minhas inúmeras objeções!"**

*translation: "**You** pushed that collaboration through, against my numerous objections!"* 

Marcia, immediately apologetic, hands up to ward off Majhee's anger

Marcia: **"Eu *sei*, mas como presidente eu tive que considerar as opiniões do conselho!"**

*translation: "I *know*, but as president I had to consider the opinions of the board!"*

Majhee interrupts: **"Somos todos cientistas, Marcia! Nós devemos priorizar maior conhencimento e acesso para *tudos*...não apenas o insanamente rico!"**

*translation: "We're all scientists, Marcia! We're supposed to prioritize greater knowledge and access for **everyone**...not just the insanely wealthy!"*

Marcia, defeated: **"*Sigh*. Só...tenha cuidado..."**

*translation: "**Sigh**. Just...be careful..."*

Marcia glances over her shoulder, then leans in to Majhee.

Marcia, low and careful: **"...há rumores que Space Consortium estão tentando *armar* eSyrup!"**

*translation: "...there are rumors that Space Consortium is trying to **weaponize** eSyrup!"*

Majhee, incredulous: **"Eles o que--?!"**

*translation: "They what--?!"*

Felix, a scientist in Majhee's lab, appears at the doorway, breathless and distraught.

Felix: **"Majhee, meu pai-- Director Netto!"**

*translation: "Majhee, my father-- Director Netto!"*

Majhee: **"Sinto muito, Marcia, vamos ter que continuar isso outra hora."**

*translation: "I'm sorry Marcia, we'll have to continue this another time."*

### Page 6

Majhee, Felix, and other members of Majhee's research group sit or stand in a cluster at one end of their lab benches in an upper floor of the research institute. The wall nearest to them is a floor-to-ceiling window, showing the dusty sky-line of São Paulo. The sun sits in a reddish hazy sky, just past the midday zenith. 

Majhee: **"Entou. Seu pai foi diagnosticada otra vez."**

*translation: "So. Your father has been diagnosed again."*

The circle of researchers: **Felix Grael**, a pale but handsome man in his late 20s, raised in Rio de Janeiro by Swedish immigrants who have since returned to Europe, his face lined with fear and sadness, head in hands as his elbows rest on his knees; **Kai Oliveira**, a much older woman of Japanese-Portuguese descent, grey-haired and hook-nosed, stern-faced and sitting stiffly in her chair; **Beatriz Cavalcanti**, a tall woman in her 30s, a Brazilian of Italian descent, mouth set in a grim line even as her hands squeeze Felix's shoulders in a motherly, comforting gesture; **Breno Leite**, a dark, thin man in his early 30s, born and raised in the streets of São Paulo by his young Brazilian single mother, who worked every day of her life before falling ill in order to send her son to university; **Nova Jatobá**, a young graduate student in her mid-20s, descended from indiginous Brazilians from deeper inland, her plump face lined with exhaustion; **Iara Gracie**, another young grad student in her mid-20s, who was born into an [old Brazilian martial arts family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gracie_family) but chose the life of a scientist instead; **Vec Barbosa**, a portly Brazilian man of West African descent in his 40s, hands resignedly folded over a substantial beer belly, face troubled and sad behind a rather bushy yet neatly-trimmed beard.

Vec, to Felix: **"Já nós demos a equipe médica de seu pai no acesso ao nosso banco de dados sobre pacientes com câncer de cutânea repetido."**

*translation: "We've already given your father's medical team access to our database on repeat skin cancer patients."*

Beatriz, kindly: **"Mas seu pai teve um transplante de fígado, no? Se queres ir casa..."**

*translation: "But your father had a liver transplant last year, no? If you want to go home..."*

Felix, defeated: **"Não há nada que eu possa fazer lá de qualquer maneira..."**

*translation: "There's nothing I can do there anyway..."*

Felix now looks furious, eyes red and glistening with held-back tears.

Felix: **"...e nós temos que continuar, antes Space Consortium patenteiam *qualquer* outra coisa!"**

*translation: "...and we have to keep going, before Space Consortium patents **anything** else!"*

Felix covers his face with his hands, furious at the tears that have started to stream down his face.

Beatriz: **"Tenho a *certeza* poderíamos gerenciar--"**

*translation: "I'm **sure** we could manage--"*

### Page 7

Kai, arms folded, looking down at her lap with hard eyes.

Kai: **"Não podemos terminar a tempo sem o Felix. Emenda é mais arte do que o algoritmo, e desde que minhas mãos começando a doer muito, Felix é o nosso *melhor*."**

*translation: "We can't finish in time without Felix. Splicing's more art than algorithm, and ever since my hands starting hurting too much, Felix is our **best**."*

Kai's brow furrows with frustration. 

Kai: **"Embora... nosso melhor pode não ser suficiente... Space Consortium anunciou sua eSyrup-emendado [halobacterium](cen.acs.org/energy/solar-power/Organic-solar-cell-smashes-performance/96/web/2018/08) há alguns dias atras. Além disso, esta manhã eu tenho *isso*."**

*translation: "Although...our best may not be enough...Space Consortium just announced their eSyrup-spliced [halobacterium](cen.acs.org/energy/solar-power/Organic-solar-cell-smashes-performance/96/web/2018/08) a few days ago. Also, this morning I got **this**."*

Kai passes up a small card to Majhee. Majhee reads from it.

Majhee: **"Você foi esbofeteado nos pulsos. Não nos faças ir para a tua garganta."**

*translation: "You've been slapped on the wrists. Don't make us go for your throat."*

Nova, looking terrified: **"O que isso quer dizer?"**

*translation: "What's that supposed to mean??"*

Kai: **"Space Consortium estão nos dizendo para parar de competir com eles. Processar-nos por patentes exclusivas no eSyrup foi o tapa nos pulsos."**

*translation: "Space Consortium's telling us to stop competing with them. Suing us for exclusive patents on eSyrup fuel was the slap on the wrists."*

Everyone takes a moment to imagine what it might be like if Space Consortium went for their throats. 

Iara: **"Meu avô ligou esta manhã...ele foi oferecido 10 billian reais na semana passada para nosso trabalho não publicado."**

*translation: "My grandfather called this morning...he was offered 10 billian reais last week for our unpublished work."*

Felix: **"Que??"**

*translation: "What??"*

Iara: **"Aparentemente esse não foi a primeira vez...ele tem uma oferta semelhante no ano passado, mas ele pensou que não valeu a pena mencionar."**

*translation: "Apparently that wasn't the first time...he got a similar offer last year, but he thought it wasn't worth mentioning."*

Nova, aghast: **"10.000.000.000 reais... isso é mais do que a *investidura do Instituto*..."**

*translation: "10 billion reais...that's more than the **institute's endowment**..."*

Breno: **"Vale a pena. Uma emenda estável com bacteriana é o primeiro passo para as emendas vivas de eSyrup...que monopólio que seria..."**

*translation: "It's worth it. A stable splice with bacteria is the first step towards living eSyrup splices...what a monopoly that'd be..."*

We see Breno's moody, cynical eyes. 

Breno: **"Mas tenho certeza que é nada para um bebê de fundo de confiança como você, Iara..."**

*translation: "But I'm sure that's nothing to a trust-fund baby like you, Iara..."*

Felix: **"Vamos, Breno! *Nenhum* de nós venderia para Space Consortium."**

*translation: "Come on Breno! *None* of us would sell-out to Space Consortium!"**

### Page 8

Breno, sadly rueful, eyes pitying: **"Esse dinheiro daria a minha mãe a mesma qualidade de tratamento que seu pai recebe de graça na Suécia."**

*translation: "That money would give my mother the same quality of treatment that your father gets for free in Sweden..."*

Majhee: **"E é por isso o laboratório paga subornos dos médicos para sua mãe."**

*translation: "And that's why the lab pays doctors' bribes for your mother."*

We see the circle of researchers sitting in silence, everyone betraying varying degrees of discomfort and fear. Over this view, Majhee speaks...

Majhee: **"Trabalho neste projeto, nesta cidade, agora...é verdade, é *muito* arriscado. Se precisar sair, eu vou tirar você e sua família desta cidade e fora do radar do Space Consortium."**

*translation: "Working on this project, in this city, right now...it's true, it's **very** risky. If you need to leave, I will get you and your family out of this city and off Space Consortium's radar."*

We see now the protesters outside, their desperate, hungry faces. They hold signs and wave flags with slogans like "Não sirva aos tiranos em órbita!", "Educar crianças humanas, não máquinas corporativas!", and "Alimentar humanos não foguetes!" 

*translation: "Do not serve tyrants in orbit!", "Educate human children, not coporate machines!", "Feed humans not rockets!"*

Majhee: **"Mas se nós não começ estes protocolos de eSyrup no domínio público, muitos sofrerão porque não podem pagar o preço do Space Consortium."**

*translation: "But if we don't get these eSyrup protocols into the public domain, many will suffer because they can't pay Space Consortium's price."*

Now we zoom out to see the hazy sun shining over the sky-line of São Paulo.

Majhee: **"Entou, se você ficar...eu juro proteger você e suas famílias de qualquer maneira que eu puder."**

*translation: "So, if you stay...I swear to protect you and your families in any way that I can."*

### Page 9

**"6 months later: Massachusetts, USA"**

We see rolling countryside, vibrant with autumn colors, behind a low row of concrete warehouses, labeled "Morei Textiles". 

Off-panel, secretary: **"Iúna, the folks from the World Health Organization are here."**

Off-panel, Iúna: **"Thanks, I'll be with them in a minute."**

We see the inside of a warehouse, where long rows of industrial looms weave eSyrup textiles. Their combined activity generates a gently deafening **"WHIRRRRR"**. Iúna Morei, a tall shapely American woman of Portuguese descent in her early 30s, lustrous wavy brown hair pulled up into a bun, an infant with thick black hair strapped to her front, walks briskly and confidently away from a door labeled "Quiet Room" towards a group of humans waiting near the main entrance of the warehouse. 

Iúna smiles and yells as she waves towards her office door, just next to the entrance to the warehouse and labeled "Iúna Morei, CEO of Morei Textiles".

Iúna: **"HELLO! SHALL WE STEP INTO MY OFFICE?"**

### Page 10

Iúna: **"Thank you for bringing the new protocols from São Paulo."**

Dr. Kauffmann: **"You know, you'd get these updates a lot faster if you'd just get a body mod..."**

Iúna gives the delegation from the World Health Organization a kind smile. 

Iúna: **"Dr. Kauffmann, I must admit I'm adamantly opposed to body modifications and eSyrup implants. I'm extremely grateful that you've taken the time to travel all the way from DC today."**

Dr. Kauffmann: **"We were in Boston for an emergency conference, so it wasn't far. Besides, no one can beat your [MERV ratings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_efficiency_reporting_value)...got your organzas in every window of my house."**

Iúna: **"Just doing what we can. What's the emergency conference about?"**

Under this dialogue is a view of Iúna's desk. We see sneak peek's of the new splicing and voltage-treatment protocols visualized with light, a floating sphere controlled by a thick piece of eSyrup canvas, stretched on a semi-circular frame that, when Iúna stands inside of it, places the canvas at about hip height, easy to reach while standing. 

### Page 11

Dr. Kauffmann: **"They're preparing themselves for a huge wave of refugees."**

Iúna: **"Really? From where?"** 

Dr. Kauffmann: **"Didn't you hear? A police raid in L.A. this morning started a huge fire that's spread halfway up the coast of California. It's so big it's getting blown over the mountains into Arizona..."**

Iúna: **"What?? How many dead??"**

Dr. Kauffmann: **"Unfortunately we haven't had a chance to count yet. Thousands are already homeless."**

Iúna: **"How does a *police raid* start a *state-wide fire*??"**

Dr. Kauffmann: **"It's all that plastic furniture, they're basically *solid* petroleum...I'm sorry, I should have realised you hadn't heard yet...do you know anyone over there?"**

Iúna: **"Yes, I...I'm sorry, I need to make a call..."**

Dr. Kauffmann: **"Of course. We'll see ourselves out."**

Under this dialogue we see close-up views of the baby strapped to Iúna's front. The child is a little less than one year old. The strapping is an intricately folded piece of eSyrup cloth that can amplify the baby's heartrate, breathing, and digestive sounds. 

### Page 12

Iúna: **"*Tahoe, have you been able to contact Joshua Tree?*"**

Iúna's Biononymous contact at Green Haven Tahoe: **"*Negative, Mama Bird.*"**

Iúna: **"*How is Tahoe?*"**

Tahoe: **"*Fire hasn't gotten further than Fresno, but we're getting ready to offer sanctuary.*"**

Iúna: **"*So...it *was* the body mod?*"**

Tahoe: **"*Looks like it. They didn't even bother going for the decoy.*"**

Under this dialogue, we see Iúna, who is now outside, and her baby is no longer strapped to her chest. Instead, her face is covered in a thick veil and she wears what looks like a heavy, full-sleeved and full-length apron. eSyrup circuits flash within the weave of both Iúna's veil and apron. She stands, facing west, arms flung out wide, back straight and tall, legs apart, boots planted firmly in the frosty grass. 

Iúna ponders for a moment, her face furrowed with grief and concentration.

Iúna: **"*Tahoe, I've changed my mind. I vote for registering as a religion.*"**

Tahoe: **"*Seriously?*"**

Iúna: **"*Yes. Pigsah was right - once schools require head mods for every student, once every job requires body mods in order to be qualified...our children won't have any choice. They'll need body mods just to* survive."**

Tahoe: **"*But...doesn't that feel too much like a* cult??"**

Iúna: **"*That's why I intially voted against it. But Tahoe, do you know what that group in Brazil published last month?*"**

Tahoe: **"*What?*"**

Iúna: **"*The first successful splice of eSyrup with living cells - eSyrup *biofilm*!*"**

Tahoe: **"*...Sorry Mama Bird, I don't follow. Why should I care about biofilm?*"**

Iúna: **"*Remember the mechapet idea?* It's possible now!!"**

### Chapter Title Page

**"Loading Universal Record..."**

**"Finished loading...'A Beginner's Guide to eSyrup: Introduction'; [Classification: *Unclassified*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information#Typical_classification_levels)."**

**"eSyrup was first synthesized in the 2040s by researchers trying to directly interface silicon circuits with biological tissue. These researchers managed to create a [yeast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeast) mutant that, when cultured with lactic acid bacteria and fed water and sand, decomposes the [silicon dioxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_dioxide) found in most sand. When left unperturbed, this self-replicating bacterial culture generates spontaneous patterned electrical activity that move like waves across the culture, similar to the electrical activity in developing animal eyes called [retinal waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal_waves), which induce the atoms within this culture to self-assemble into [hyphae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypha)-like sections which can then mimic the behaviour of any component in a classical electronic circuit. Furthermore, eSyrup cultures can be "voltage-treated", via methods similar to those used for field programmable gate arrays [(FPGA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array) or field programmable analog arrays [(FPAA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_analog_array), to engineer structures to meet custom designs and needs. Interestingly, eSyrup structures do not seem to be powered by electricity; instead, they seem to convert CO2 into glucose via an unknown method that may be related to or derived from the [Calvin cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-independent_reactions)..."**

**"2067: Ushuaia, Argentina"**

We see a bustling harbour town, everything about it small and cute except for the occassional warehouse factory or modern high rise office building - these were clearly very recent additions to a place that otherwise hadn't changed very much in many hundreds of years.

**"When growing a personal supply of eSyrup, say, for research or for fun, you can feed it enough silica just by running down to the beach once a week with a soup bowl."**

**"Industrialized eSyrup production, however, needs quite a bit of silica."**

**"Sand mining was out of the question - wouldn't want to tarnish Space Consortium's brand with news of their operations destroying delicate coastal ecosystems or picturesque beachside communities."**

**"So they turned to the next biggest source of biogenic silica - deep-sea deposits in the [Antarctic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biogenic_silica#Major_silica_sinks_in_the_modern_oceans)."**

We see close-ups of the [wildlife at Cabo de Hornos](https://youtu.be/06LcgVQg7Yk) with tumultuous ocean and raw, mountainous landscape. Off in the distance, we see a tiny speck on the horizon - a deep-sea silica mining rig. A tiny plume of smoke, looking both innocent and foreboding, curls up from the rig.

**"Ocean Acidification Monitoring Station, Havana, Cuba"**

Researchers stare in horror at the read-outs of their remote monitoring systems, displayed using a room-sized **INFO-SPHERE**. A hurricane rages outside. On the info-sphere blinks an ominous, large "6.9", tagged as "pH, Ocean Surface". 

Technician: **"Dr. Molina! Dr. Molina!"**

Dr. Molina, already looking harried, sticks their head into the room. 

*Dr. Molina is a descendent of [Hilda Molina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilda_Molina).*

Dr. Molina: **"¿Qué es?"**

**"Thermohaline Circulation Observation Centre, Orkney Islands"**

Dr. Fischmann: **"Members of the UN, good afternoon. My name is Dr. Geraldine Fischman, and I'm head of the environmental monitoring team for the Thermohaline Circulation Observation Collective. The TCOC has been monitoring the North Atlantic for the past 44 years, and we think we have an explanation for the recent drop in energy production by UN-deployed sea turbines."**

A room-sized **INFO-SPHERE** creates photonic representations of several government leaders around the world. Dr. Fischmann, a tall, hook-nosed woman with incredibly built thighs walks through a 3-dimensional video recording of rivers and waterfalls *pouring* off of a glacier into the fjords surrounding it. Overlayed with light are labels with meta data and more in-depth treatments of certain phenomena being shown in the video, appearing when one of the photonic representations of government leaders move their gaze over that part of the video. 

The [meta-data (see "Chapter 3" on the right of the page)](http://www.ipcc.ch/report/sr15/): 
* global sea surface temperatures have increased to 1.7 deg C above pre-industrial era temperatures
* sea levels have risen 0.64 meters since 2020
* average temperature on the hottest day of the year has increased to 2.2 deg C above pre-industrial era temperatures
* average temperature on the coldest night of the year has increased to 7.7 deg C above pre-industrial era temperatures

Dr. Fischmann: **"These videos are from 15 years ago, when a significant meltdown of the Greenland Ice Sheet finally convinced the United States and China to place a meaningful tax on carbon dioxide emissions, and members of the Paris Agreement switched to [marine current power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_current_power) for electricity generation."**

*note: [biggest usage of coal right now is currently for fuel, only 20% is for electricity](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/10/dangerous-global-warming-will-happen-sooner-than-thought-study)- did the world switch to renewables in time?*

### Page 4

The videos switch to another view of the same glacier, now noticeably reduced, but a slightly different coastline. The glacier doesn't seem to be melting anymore, and enormous, thick chunks of [drift ice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drift_ice) clog up the sea like a traffic jam. 

Dr. Fischmann: **"This is a view of Greenland earlier this year, from sensor buoys in the Denmark Strait. Normally, the [West Ice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ice) doesn't extend this far south, but the drastic melting 15 years ago triggered a long-term, slow melting of the ice sheet."**

Now the meta data shows: 
* Gulf Stream has slowed by 65% since the late 1950s
* [Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_meridional_overturning_circulation) has been [declining at an average rate of 0.9 Sverdrup (a million cubic meters per second, the standard unit for ocean circulation) per year since 2004](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/348/6241/1255575).
  * useful image: http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/348/6241/1255575/F1.large.jpg?width=800&height=600&carousel=1

Dr. Fischmann: **"The fresh water freezes more readily than the salty sea, resulting in more ice on the ocean's surface. We believe that this greater incidence of pack ice is blocking major currents that run through the Denmark Strait."**

Gov official: **"Can't we just clear the ice, then?"**

Dr. Fischmann: **"It's not so simple. Our [original predictions](https://tethys.pnnl.gov) about the impact of sea turbines on the marine ecosystem seem to have been...optimistic. This slow down may not be reversible, and [if ocean currents stop entirely](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shutdown_of_thermohaline_circulation), the UK and northern Europe will *freeze*."**

**"São Paulo, Brazil"**

The orderly protest crowds in front of the Laboratório Nacional de Biociências e Saúde Pública are gone, replaced by utter chaos. Everyone on the street is now wearing industrial filter respirators and knee-length rubber water boots - the streets are ankle-deep in polluted, acidic ocean water. Rain, highly dosed with nitric acid, pours from the sky. We see Majhee, fully dressed in protective gear and a breathing mask, weave her way through a crowd and rush into the front door of the research institute. 

**"2 months ago, when [NO2 poisoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_dioxide_poisoning)	landed half of the city in hospitals, Felix moved back to Sweden to be with his dying father..."**

**"...1 month ago, when all the supermarkets started opening just once a week instead of every day, Breno moved with his mother back to her hometown, just north of Brasilia..."**

**"...and 11 days ago, hours after celebrating the birth of Nimh, the first mouse spliced with raw eSyrup, Iara's body was found on a rooftop in Centro..."**

### Page 6

Kai, Beatriz, Nova, and Vec are in the same area where they were having a lab meeting, last we saw them - now they are frantically packing lab equipment and eSyrup cultures, and copying research notes then deleting/shredding/destroying them. Off to one side is an unfamiliar older man and a teenaged boy keeping two very young children out of the fray. The teenaged boy looks related to Nova. The two young children look related to the unfamiliar older man and Beatriz, one looking about 6 and the other looking about 3. The little one has short hair, tied into a puffy short ponytail at the very top of her head; the older one has long straight hair that just brushes his shoulders; they both stare at the frantic activity with wide eyes. 

Majhee: **"Precisamos terminar de embalar *agora*."**

*translation: "We need to finish packing **now**."*

Vec pulls aside Majhee. Vec looks incredibly troubled.  

Vec: **"Majhee, o que fazemos com Nimh??"**

*translation: "Majhee, what do we with Nimh??"*

Majhee: **"Qual é a condição dela?"**

*translation: "What's her condition?"*

Vec: **"Seu esofagus e traqueia não se juntam corretamente. Eu não acho que [Sonic Hedgehog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_hedgehog) é um vetor viável!"**

*translation: "Her esophogus and trachea didn't join properly. I don't think [Sonic Hedgehog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_hedgehog) is a viable vector!"*

### Page 7

Majhee places a hand on Vec's shoulder to calm him. 

Majhee: **"Que grande é vazamento? Podemos remendá-lo?"**

*translation: "How big is the leak? Can we patch it?"*

Vec: **"É fino, mas *longo*. Nova quer tentar, mas Kai e Beatriz acho que vai demorar muito tempo."**

*translation: "It's thin but *long*. Nova wants to try, but Kai and Beatriz think it's a waste of time."*

Vec looks emotionally wrecked. 

Vec: **"Eu vou ajudar a nova, se você acha que é uma boa idéia.

*translation: "I will help Nova, if you think it's a good idea."*

Majhee stares at the pouring rain outside, the streets below awash with sea water, lost belongings, and garbage. People with insufficient protection from the nitric acid heavy rain are screaming and bleeding. After a long silence, Majhee speaks softly.

Majhee: **"Mesmo que funcione... como vamos transportar um rato transgênico pós-operatório através de [chuva e inundação de ácida](http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg1/WG1AR5_SPM_FINAL.pdf)?"**

*translation: "Even if it works... how do we transport a post-op transgenic rat through [acid rain and flood](http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg1/WG1AR5_SPM_FINAL.pdf)?"*

Majhee: **"Dê a ela 3 millilitros de [Sodium Pentobarbital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentobarbital#Euthanasia), e enviar todos os nossos dados para a Suécia. Felix terá mais tempo."**

*translation: "Give her 3 milliliters of [Sodium Pentobarbital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentobarbital#Euthanasia), and send all of our data to Sweden. Felix will have more time."*

### Page 8

Majhee turns back to the rest of the room and greets the older man with a hug and a kiss on the cheek. He gives Majhee a tired smile. 

Majhee: **"Que bom que está aqui, Demetrio, como está?"**

*translation: "Glad you're here, Demetrio, how are you?"*

Demetrio: **"Assim como um pode ser, dada a situação."**

*translation: "As well as one can be, given the situation."*

Majhee hugs the teenaged boy. 

Majhee: **"E Amana, todo bem?"**

*translation: "And Amana, you alright?"*

Amana looks terrified, and nearly crying from the effort of keeping his cool in front of the smaller children. 

Amana: **"Dr. Suh, onde estamos indo?"**

*translation: "Dr. Suh, where are we going?"*

### Page 9

Majhee squats to be eye level with the two little children, and gathers them and Amana around her. Demetrio crouches behind the two little ones and places a comforting hand on the boy's shoulder. Majhee smiles extra brightly at the little girl. 

Majhee: **"Então! Nicola, Nerio, vamos caminhar *muito longe*, para uma montanha com um *parte superior lisa*, como uma mesa! *Mas*, no caminho, a *chuva* é *lava*, eo *ar* é lava, por isso precisamos manter a lava *fora* de nossas peles, *não importa o que*. Me entende?"**

*translation: "So! Nicola, Nerio, we are going walk *very far*, to a mountain with a *flat top*, like a table! *But*, on the way, the *rain* is *lava*, and the *air* is lava, so we need to keep the lava *off* of our skins, *no matter what*. Do you understand?"**

Nicola squeels and smiles shyly, raising her arms and hiding her face in her father's knee. Nerio nods somber-faced, one hand on his father's other knee. 

Majhee shifts her attention to Amana. 

Majhee: **"Lembras-te do nosso último retiro de laboratório, quando fomos mergulhar? Você vai vir comigo para trazer as roupas de mergulho aqui."**

*translation: "Do you remember our last lab retreat, when we went SCUBA diving? You're gonna help me bring the wetsuits up here."*

### Page 10

**"In 2067, the safety valves on Space Consortium's deep-sea silica harvesting rig in the Antarctic failed to activate, spewing partially distilled volcanic fumes, heavy with silicon tetraflouride, into the southern ocean currents. The disaster belched a huge cloud of hydrogen flouride into the [West Wind Drift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctic_Circumpolar_Current), mixing the highly corrosive gas into an already critically damaged atmosphere, and lowering the pH of an already fatally acidic ocean."**

*In volcanic fumes, [silicon tetrafluoride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_tetrafluoride) forms [hexafluorosilicic acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexafluorosilicic_acid), which can further hydrolyze to [hydroflouric acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrofluoric_acid).*

**"The catastrophe killed 32 people and sank the harvesting rig into the sea. For weeks, the silicon tetraflouride plumes belched unchecked into the Antarctic Convergence."**

**"Everyone fled underground, trying to hide from the huge clouds of poisonous gas and acid rain that were sweeping across the globe in terrifyingly [large and increasingly frequent cyclones](http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg1/WG1AR5_SPM_FINAL.pdf)."**

Over a backdrop of the "Earth as a marble in space" image, showing intense cyclonic activity, we see:
* Majhee leading her research team as they get their first glimpse of the [Mato Grasso Plateau](https://www.britannica.com/place/Mato-Grosso-Plateau), all of them completely covered in neoprene and goggles and breathing masks and rubber boots. 
* Iúna and her son João queue in line to beg asylum in caves in Vermont to escape the poisonous atmosphere. They are both well covered in Iúna's best eSyrup textiles. Other people aren't so lucky. 

### Page 11

**"Amid the chaos, nearly 60,000 planetside humans fled into orbit."**

A huge crowd of desperate people try to shove themselves onto four enormous Space Barges attached to the same [elevator cable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_elevator#Climbers), but it's clear that even these behemoth vessels will not fit everyone in the launch station. The Space Barge launch station staff try to maintain order but everyone is in a hysterical panic. Three of the Space Barges have already closed their doors, their energy cells glowing as they prepare to climb up the eSyrup-doped elevator cable. 

There are nearly 10 additional empty [launch tracks](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/people-are-still-trying-build-space-elevator-180957877/) but they are all empty.   

Person in the crowd: **"Why aren't the other barges coming back???"**

The last Space Barge begins to close its doors. People totally lose their shit. 

PA: **"Please step away from the safety barrier!! Please step AWAY from the safety barrier!!"**

**"Afraid to take on more refugees, the Space Consortium shut down the Shuttle Barge service, 'until further notice'."**

# The Story, Part 2

## Interlude

*Little by little the night turns around  
Counting the leaves which tremble at dawn  
Lotuses lean on each other in yearning  
Under the eaves the swallow is resting*

*Set the controls for the heart of the sun*

*Over the mountain watching the watcher  
Breaking the darkness  
Waking the grapevine  
One inch of love is one inch of shadow  
Love is the shadow that ripens the wine*

*Set the controls for the heart of the sun  
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun*

*Witness the man who raves at the wall  
Making the shape of his questions to Heaven  
Whether the sun will fall in the evening  
Will he remember the lesson of giving?*

*Set the controls for the heart of the sun  
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun*

## Chapter 3: A Fearful Trill of Things Unknown but Longed for Still

Character designs: Asoka Morei, Iri, Eireena McLeland, Serena Ramirez

### Chapter Title Page

**"Loading Universal Record..."**

**"Finished loading...'A Beginner's Guide to eSyrup: eSyrup Stitching'; [Classification: *Unclassified*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information#Typical_classification_levels)."**

**"By forming chains or three-dimensional networks of eSyrup hyphae, using a form of [polymerization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerization), eSyrup can be molecularly "stitched" to various inorganic materials, such as metals, ceramics, glass, and plastic, in order to give them flexible electro-chemical properties. Organic materials, such as textiles (wool, cotton, hemp, flax) and paper, can also be "sitched" with eSyrup. The exact nature of this electro-chemical flexibility depends on the grade of eSyrup used in the stitching process. In certain grades of eSyrup, the [septum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septum) separating the cells of the hyphae are bioengineered to be composed of very small [hexagons](https://www.quora.com/Geometry-Why-do-we-see-hexagons-in-nature-so-often) with a very high density of pores to increase the flow rate of [organelles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organelle), nutrients, and ions throughout the hyphae. The hexagonal sections of septum are flexibly linked to each other, and the resulting eSyrup product can be independently reconfigured almost indefinitely (called "flexible eSyrup" or "flex-eSyrup"). However, these grades of eSyrup require more frequent feeding in order to power their reactivity. Cheaper grades of eSyrup are made of hyphae with less porous septums, which are also composed of larger hexagons; this severely limits the ability of these grades to reconfigure (called "fixed eSyrup")..."**

### Page 1

4 jagged panels. 1st POV of running, terrified, through a harsh and rocky landscape. Flash of memory: enormous fangs; cold, blood-red eyes. A farming village in ruins, fires consuming the large interconnected home structures and surrounding greenhouses. Dead bodies, mangled by the monstrous wolf-like creatures that are the size of a small elephant. 

Asoka trips, falling face veil down in the dirt. Their mechapet, a synthetic creature made to look like a cuttlefish and brought alive using eSyrup technology, chitters frantically from where it is wrapped around Asoka's neck, sheet-white with fear. Asoka's clothes are drenched in fear sweat, gloves muddy, face veil reflecting a face of terror and horror. Everything is covered in dust and dirt. 

Asoka: *"Dad...Mom...Pippa!!"*

We see Asoka clench their fist, then throw up their head, struggle to stand, eyes streaming with tears. 

Asoka: *"Must...reach...the next...Haven!"*

### Page 2

**"Earlier that morning..."**

**"2116: Green Haven Howes, North America"**

We see a fist holding a bunch of wheat straws, and another hand reaching for a straw. 

Pippa, off-panel: **"*Aw, *seriously*?*"**

We see a crowd of Biononymous children gathered in a outdoor pavilion with a dirt floor, all wearing the compulsory clothing of their cult: a simple sleeveless shirt tucked into baggy trousers in the style of [shalwar kameez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shalwar_kameez); a light long sleeve jacket, loose and fastening up the front, covered in a variety of simple geometric embroidery patterns, sleeves cinched at the wrists; gloves tucked into the sleeves; head veil with identical cartoon schematics of a face embroidered onto each with eSyrup thread; boots, with the trousers tucked in. Each child also has an eSyrup mechapet curled around their arms, legs, necks; sitting on heads, shoulders; or eagerly following their heels. Some of the children have straws of varying lengths in their hands. One child, smaller than the rest of the other children, a mechapet shaped like an American Crow sitting on their shoulder, is holding a very short straw, and the face on their head veil is a definite pout. 

Pippa: **"*I did the far hill field *yesterday*!*"**

Biononymous child holding the fist of straws: **"*Think of it this way, Pippa...you get to spend the most time above ground today!*"**

Pippa: **"*But it's not fair, Io! I'm the smallest, and it's so far away!*"**

Io: **"*We all agreed!*"**

We see tiny gloved hands try to shove the short straw back into an only slightly larger fist of straws. 

Pippa: **"*Take it back, let me pick again!*"**

A taller, lankier Biononymous child, a cuttlefish mechapet curled around their neck, steps in between them and calmly separates them. 

Asoka: **"*Come on, Pippa, I'll help you.*"**

### Page 3

Asoka and Pippa roll two large plastic barrels on a grassy path up a steep, terraced hill, towards a long row of tall greenhouses. The barrels are heavy with water and the two children lean their whole bodies into the endeavor. The cuttlefish mechapet holds two large woven shade-fans over the children's heads, while the crow mechapet moves sticks and other obstacles out of their path. 

Pippa: **"*No, *Soka-aa*, Io was cheating, I know it! They haven't had to work further away than the apple trees ever since we started trying out all of their 'work assignment algorithms'...*"**

Asoka: **"*But don't you like being above ground? This is my favorite part of being a Biononymous!*"**

Pippa: **"*Stop being so happy when I'm telling you about my bad luck!*"**

At the top of the path, slightly above the row of greenhouses, is a row of spigots with hose attachments. Asoka is carefully placing their barrel against a rusted metal barrel holder. Pippa, whose barrel is already placed in a barrel holder, is crouched in front of their barrel, and struggles with the hose attachments. 

Pippa: **"*These are always so hard to do with gloves...*"**

Asoka gives Pippa a wink and a thumbs up before tending to their own hose attachment.

Asoka: **"*You got this!*"**

### Page 4

The two children watch the water flow through the gravity-powered aquaduct system, gently scattering moisture onto the plants inside the greenhouse.

Asoka: **"*Wanna know a secret to making your luck better?*"**

Pippa: **"*Yes!*"**

Asoka: **"*Before picking a straw, or rolling dice, think of the worst possible outcome.*"**

Pippa: **"*The worst?!*"**

Asoka: **"*Then think about how you would get what you want even if you had the worst luck, and shout in your head, 'I don't care if the worst happens! I can handle it!!'*"**

Asoka: **"*Then the bad luck gets scared, and knows it can't have fun with you.*"**

### Page 5

Iri and Manut play, as Asoka turns towards a delicious smell floating up the valley towards them. 

Asoka: **"*Smells like Jeshua's making butter buns today...*"**

Pippa looks miserable. 

Pippa: **"*We're so far away, they'll be cold by the time we get back. Why do we have a grove all the way up here anyway?*"**

Asoka smiles kindly via their face veil. 

Asoka: **"*These are the plants that evolved the fastest, so they can handle more sun...the others still need the protection of the valley...*"**

Asoka crouches to be face level with Pippa.

Asoka: **"*If I take care of the weeding, will you run back now and bring me a hot bun?*"**

Pippa beams with joy and gratitude. 

Pippa: **"*Really? Yes!*"**

### Page 6

Pippa runs off, crow mechapet flying overhead. 

Pippa: **"*Thanks Soka! Come on Manut!*"**

Asoka looks at their cuttlefish mechapet, hands resolutely on their hips. 

Asoka: **"*Alright, Iri, let's do this!*"**

Iri chirps with happy determination, holding up weeding trowels in its arms in a celebratory gesture. 

Iri: **"Yeah!"**

Panels show Asoka and Iri weeding the plants in the greenhouse. Have some nice botany spreads of future plants that have been genetically engineered to deal with a heavy NO2, CO2, and CH4 (Methane) content. The plants need to have ways of reducing their overgrowth thanks to the abundance of CO2 and they need to still sequester enough nutrients for them to be worth growing and eating. What do the 3 sisters (beans, corn, squash) need to change in order to still be a great trio?

### Page 7

Asoka: **"*All done!*"**

Asoka wipes their brow. 

Asoka: **"*Hope Pippa didn't get too distracted in the Market Cave--*"**

Suddenly Iri shrieks and goes completely white. Iri begins loudly broadcasting in the generic synthetic voices used by the Biononymous outside the privacy of their home structures. 

Iri: **"*This is an emergency broadcast from Green Haven Howes, we are under attack! Repeat, *WE ARE UNDER ATTA*--Aaaaaaaaahh!!!*"**

Iri collapses into a grey puddle as Asoka rushes over, face veil revealing their terror. 

Asoka: **"*Attack?!*"**

Asoka scoops up Iri and begins running down the valley, but Iri suddenly re-animates and broadcasts another voice not its own. 

Iri: **"Soka, stay away, don't come back!!"**

Asoka clutches Iri to their chest, looking down the mountainside with terrified eyes at the sight of enormous beasts, moving impossibly fast, tearing through their village, aghast to hear...

Asoka: **"*Dad??!!*"**

Iri/João: **"It's the **BEASTS**!! Run Soka! *RUN!!*"**

### Page 8

It's night. A village with a central housing structure identical to Asoka's home village, also surrounded by greenhouses, sleeps tranquilly amongst rolling hills and a soft, nearly full moon. A faint orange glow is visible in one corner of the central housing structure. 

Eireena, off-panel: **"I'm so sorry for your loss, Asoka."**

Inside, Asoka is kneeling, head bowed. They are wearing clean trousers and sleeveless shirt, but their feet, hands, and head are bare. Asoka's long reddish hair is tied back in a loose ponytail, and Asoka hugs Iri, who is cuddled up to Asoka in their lap. Before Asoka is a large steaming mug of hot tea, but Asoka hasn't touched it. Tears run down their face, past an upper lip that shows just the tiniest hints of fuzzy hair. 

We see Eireena McLeland, High Priestess of the Biononymous and leader of this Green Haven, a tiny woman, silver haired, wrinkled face showing deep sorrow, sitting on a floor cushion and wearing an elaborately embroidered jacket. On either side of her sit two other adult Biononymous: a man and a woman, somewhat younger than Eireena. The man looks at Asoka, his dark face sad but gaining a gleam of curiosity and fascination when he shifts his gaze to Iri. The woman's face, half-hidden behind long, thick, gently curling dark hair, is one of calm contemplation. 

They are all sitting inside a warmly lit room with a shrine centered along one wall. All of the walls are covered in tapestries, made with the finest of the Biononymous' textile and embroidery. The shrine is a figure dressed in the religious clothing of the Biononymous, legs folded into a lotus and one hand raised, akin to the Buddha, but instead of holding the palm forward, the wrist is bent and the palm is cupped, just enough to hold a bit of soil and a tiny seedling, just beginning to sprout. In front of the seated figure is a large black bird, carved out of wood and delicately painted, with long legs and a horn-like feather sticking out of its forehead -- a [horned screamer, *Anhima cornuta*](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=horned+screamer+anhima+cornuta&t=opera&iar=images&iax=images&ia=images). The figurine is surrounded by non-combusting eSyrup candles and scent-only eSyrup incense, and mid-summer blossoms. 

Eireena: **"I don't think any of the Biononymous anticipated that very many other animals would survive The Burning, especially large carnivores...it's quite strange, actually...but we will need to consider how to protect the Green Havens from these '**BEASTS**'."**

### Page 9

The fabric flap to this room opens, and another Biononymous adult enters. He addresses Eireena.

Biononymous man: **"Apologies, High Priestess, but World Government Peacekeepers have just arrived. They request an audience with you immediately."**

The other woman, sitting beside Eireena, raises an eyebrow. Her eye has a hard glint.  

Biononymous woman: **"Immediately? At this indecent hour?"** 

Eireena: **"It's alright, Serena. Charlie, please let the Peacekeepers know I'll be with them shortly."**

Charlie bows and exits. Eireena stands and looks down at Asoka, who is still kneeling with their head down, unable to look up or stand, tears streaming down their face. 

Eireena: **"It seems these days are full of the strange and the indecent. Asoka has sanctuary with us, but perhaps it would be best to keep their presence here...discreet."**

Eireena puts on her face veil. 

Eireena: **"*Fili, please escort Asoka to the infirmary and see to their needs. Serena, please come with me.*"**

Fili and Serena both bow: **"Yes, High Priestess."**

### Page 10

It is the next morning. Asoka sits on the edge of their bed in the infirmary, a thick, sturdy mattress in the style of Japanese futons, on a [tatami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatami)-style floor. Asoka's bare feet are on the tatami, knees bent up under their folded arms, in which they rest their head. Their eyes are tired and puffy. Iri tenderly combs Asoka's hair with its arms as it cuddles in the space between Asoka's knees and chest. Fili pushes back the door tapestry to Asoka's room, carrying a tray of food. Fili is also barefoot and without his face veil or jacket. 

Fili: **"Good morning. Did you sleep at all?"**

Asoka, without looking up, straightens their back and lowers their knees into a cross-legged sitting position. They look too dejected to talk. Iri timidly peers at Fili from around Asoka's arms, which still hold Iri close. 

Fili sets down the tray and sits across from Asoka, whose eyes have started to leak tears again. Fili looks at Asoka sadly, then gives a little smile. 

Fili: **"Fresh raspberries? Just picked them this morning."**

Asoka doesn't react. Fili tries again. 

Fili: **"Does your mechapet eat? What's its name again, Iri?"**

Asoka still shows no reaction. Fili's smile drops and he looks down. 

Fili: **"It's ok to feel pain, but please, you must eat. It would dishonour your entire Haven if you were to starve yourself to death."**

Asoka finally looks at Fili. After a moment, Asoka reaches for a raspberry. Fili smiles encouragingly. 

### Page 11

A scratch at the door. Eireena enters with Serena. Fili stands and bows. Asoka also stands, abruptly remembering their manners as Iri darts to their shoulder and hides behind their hair. While standing, Asoka knocks over the raspberries. Asoka looks mortified. 

Asoka: **"Oh no! I'm so sorry!"**

Asoka rushes to pick up the scattered raspberries. Eireena holds up a hand to stop Asoka and smiles wryly as Serena calmly gathers the rest of the raspberries, which mostly scattered in her direction anyway. 

Eireena: **"Please, eat those, and sit."**

Serena returns the raspberries to their bowl, and Fili exits. Asoka sits on their bed futon, obediently shoving a raspberry into their mouth, while Serena and Eireena sit on floor cushions. 

Eireena: **"Asoka, I want to tell you why the Peacekeepers visited us last night. Is this something you think you can hear right now?"**

Asoka looks at Eireena, suddenly scared. The raspberries in Asoka's hand have been crushed by their sudden tension.

Eireena: **"If you hear what I have to say, and all you want is to hide some place safe for the rest of your life, I guarantee that you will have that place with us. Do you understand?"**

Asoka nods: **"Yes"**

### Page 12

Eireena: **"Good. Last night, Lieutenant Colonel Santiago Garcia of the World Government Peacekeepers told the Green Haven Clarksville Council that he has received multiple reports of the Green Havens being attacked by large wolf-like creatures. We also learned that Demario Jones has convinced the Underground Cities to refuse sanctuary for the Biononymous, saying that there is already massive overcrowding. I don't know how he thinks he can feed [800 thousand people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography_of_the_United_States) without the Green Havens..."**

A panel of flashback: the salivating fangs, the terribly cold eyes, a sense of impossibly fast movement for something so large. 

Eireena: **"Anyway, the Colonel claims that although they can track these creatures, the creatures move too quickly for the Peacekeepers to hunt them down. Nonetheless, he offered to station a platoon of 40 Peacekeepers at our Green Haven as protection, in case the creatures try to attack us."**

Eireena lets her cynicism creep onto her face. 

Eireena: **"We have no choice but to accept...our ties with the Underground Cities are cut, and soon, I fear that no Green Haven will be without World Government military presence. I don't need to say how much this will compromise our dedication to anonymity and a life free from surveillance."**

Eireena now looks hard at Asoka. 

Eireena: **"If you take your sanctuary with us, this is the life we forsee having to accept. However...if you feel able to travel a more dangerous path...there is another option."**

**"Loading Universal Record..."**

**"Finished loading...'A Beginner's Guide to eSyrup: eSyrup Splicing'; [Classification: *Clearance*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information#Typical_classification_levels)."**

**"Similar to inorganic materials "stitched" with eSyrup, organic materials "spliced" with eSyrup can be either "flexible" or "fixed". In general, reconfiguring spliced eSyrup is easier than reconfiguring stitched eSyrup. eSyrup was spliced with living cells for the first time just before the Global Water Crisis. In 2076, a research group led by Dr. Majhee Suh published a protocol for growing biofilms using raw eSyrup and [*Anabaena*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anabaena), a genus of cyanobacteria. It is rumoured that this same team also discovered a method for splicing eSyrup with eukaryotic cells, but all records of this research were lost during the Global Water Crisis..."**

### Page 1

We are deep underwater. An enormous [Columbia-class](https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2017/09/3-questions-americas-next-nuclear-missile-submarine/141317/) [submarine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia-class_submarine) slips through the dark blue water. A long thin cable full of [hydrophones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrophone) [trails out behind the sub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_Towed_Array_Sensor_System). On the side of the submersible are the letters ["SSBN-831"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_submarines_of_the_United_States_Navy), the hull number of the [USS *Monterey*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_code_831), which has now been comandeered for use by the World Government Peacekeepers, the planetside branch of the World Government military. On the ocean floor below, a [remotely operated underwater vehicle(ROV)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remotely_operated_underwater_vehicle) has been [digging up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submarine_communications_cable#Cable_repair) a [submarine cable](https://www.submarinecablemap.com/#/), [no bigger than a garden hose](https://www.pri.org/stories/2015-04-20/what-links-global-internet-wires-inside-tubes-no-bigger-garden-hose), from the ocean floor and feeding it back up towards the USS *Monterey*, where the cable disappears into the bottom of the submarine. The ROV has just cut the cable. We see an exhilerated Iri taking its first swim in a real ocean. 

### Page 2

We see the inside of the submarine's [bilge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilge), the lowest compartment of the submarine, knee-high with liquid drain-off from all parts of the submersible. On an oily pipe, we see two bootprints, and a ghostly hand print on the wall next to it. Thanks to the dirty water, we see an outline of the fully camouflaged Asoka, crouching on top of the pipe and trying to make as little contact with the water below as possible. 

We catch a glimpse of Asoka's teary, miserable eyes. 

We see Iri riding the ROV back into the submarine via an escape portal being used to let the robot in and out of the sub. 

Iri, shimmering with invisibility, carefully sneaks out of the escape portal into the engine room. Suddenly, Iri sniffs -- a familiar and pleasant odor lies thick and heavy in the air.  

We see the tightly packed engine room of a nuclear submarine. A Peacekeeper wearing the insignia of [Culinary specialist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culinary_specialist_(United_States_Navy)) ducks into the door while yelling out behind them. 

Culinary specialist: **"Let me just go pull out the throttle spuds!"**

We see an unattended pile of potatoes, individually wrapped in aluminum foil, sitting on top of a metal-plated surface in the engine room. 

Next panel, we see 2 fewer potatoes. 

### Page 3

For one surreal moment (panel), we're back on a hillside near Asoka's Home Haven. A gleeful Pippa runs with their arms outstretched, imitating a flying beast as Pippa's mechapet Manut flies overhead. Iri blissfully wallows in a huge pile of fallen leaves. The colours are an autumn riot. This daydream/flashback should take up the largest panel on the page. 

Suddenly Asoka hears a "ZIIIIP!" noise above their heads.

A circlular cutout of the metal wall panel above Asoka gets pushed down into the bilge space as Iri appears with two aluminum foil wrapped potatoes and hands them to Asoka. Iri is trying very hard to look cheerful, and Asoka looks desperately hungry yet completely unenthused by yet another meal of potatoes. 

Iri: *"Happy mealtime!"*

Asoka: *"I'll never eat another potato again."*

Iri: *"I'm sure we're almost there!"*

Iri disappears, and Asoka pushes the cutout of metal back into the ceiling. They take out what look like fabric tape from their utility belt and seal the cutout. After a moment, the fabric tape seemingly melts into the surrounding metal, and it was as if there had never been a hole in the ceiling. 

Asoka begins to carefully peel a potato, face veil twisted into a resigned grimace. 

### Page 4

*--flashback--*

**"8 days ago..."**

We are back at Green Haven Clarksville, the morning after Asoka arrived and begged for sanctuary. 

Eireena: **"Apparently, stationing troops at the Green Havens wasn't Lieutenant Colonel Garcia's original mission..."** 

Serena: **"The Orbiters are all going nuts right now over some satellite footage...they think they've found humans *re-growing the Amazon rainforest*. If an entire nuclear submarine wasn't on its way over there, I'd say it's a joke...*no one* can live in the Red Zone..."**

Serena rolls her eyes with huge disappointment and disbelief. 

Serena: **"Also, I can't believe some of these Peacekeepers -- they were talking about *'magical tree people'*, and going on about how to *'civilize'* an *'un-contacted tribe'*. Idiots. If these people made it back to the surface, in the *Red Zone*, they are much more likely to be *highly advanced*."**

### Page 5

Eireena: **"This morning, we convened an emergency High Council of all the North America and Europe Havens, to discuss whether we should try to make contact before the Peacekeepers do. There are...*conflicting*...opinions...in the end, we decided to leave the choice up to *you*."**

Asoka and Iri realise that everyone is looking at them. They exchange a glance. 

Asoka: **"Me? Why would you do that?"**

Serena: **"You're generation is the first to grow up with mechapets...and you need a mechapet if you're going to wear it."**

Asoka: **"Wear what?"**

Eireena: **"Eat your raspberries, and come with me please. Bring the oatcakes and juice."**

### Page 6

Eireena leads the way, flanked by Serena and Asoka. Iri, feeling bolder, is now balanced on top of Asoka's head, who dutifully eats oatcakes and drinks juice. Asoka and Iri take comfort in the embroidered tapestry lining the hallways, depicting familiar shapes and patterns from the Biononymous textile lexicon. 

They reach a large tapestry mural depicting The Burning, and the procession slows down to admire it. The mural shows the Space Barges fleeing into orbit on their super strong and finer-than-hair space elevator cables, eSyrup-stitched [carbon nanotubes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_nanotube) sparkling as underneath, Earth collapses into chaos thanks to violent cyclones, intensely pouring acid rain, blistering heat and drought, and toxic atmospheric chemicals. The mural shows everyone planetside, including the Biononymous, fleeing underground and crowding themselves into caves. The mural then shows the years spent suffering in this underground existence, unable to grow much, without any of the basics of civilization, crowded underground with too many people. So many people die during those years, from hunger, from restless violence, and from environmental poisoning. 

Next, the mural moves on to when the Biononymous, led by Mother Bird, the First Weaver, are able to make their way back to Mother Bird's textile factories, and recover not only miles upon miles of top quality air-and-water-filtering organzas, but also the means to make more. This allows the Biononymous to create living and farming structures above ground. 

The final scene of the mural shows the Space Barges coming back to Earth, as the Orbiters return to plant the flag of the World Government on the planet. Eireen runs her hand along the World Government flag embroidered into the mural. 

Eireena: **"'World Government'...ha! Cowards who hid up in orbit for nearly *23 years*. So many people died because they couldn't get their body mods repaired or replaced, especially when we first went underground..."**

Serena: **"Everyone was so grateful that the Biononymous were willing to come above ground, but barely a generation has passed and they already feel entitled to their food...now they treat us as if we're Orbiter bots, perfect slaves that can be abused and abandoned without consequence!"**

Eireena: **"...this might sound ridiculous, but I wouldn't be surprised if the Beasts were created by the Orbiters...besides the Biononymous, there [hasn't been a creature bigger than a fox on the surface ever since the Burning](https://www.forbes.com/sites/shaenamontanari/2015/08/10/extreme-climate-warming-episode-lead-to-smaller-mammals-but-how/#70fc49157c4f), and they've been after our eSyrup splicing techniques for decades..."**

### Page 7

Further along in the hallway, Eireena pulls back a part of the tapestry wall, which, to a naive eye looks no different from any of the other wall tapestries in terms of its function. But behind this tapestry is another small room. Inside is a tall wooden dresser. Eireena holds the tapestry open and gestures Asoka inside before her. 

Eireena: **"Please, step inside."**

Serena opens the tall wooden dresser. Inside is an exquisite outfit of the Biononymous, embroidered in elaborate tiny patterns and dressed on a flat mannequin. Neatly folded in the bottom of the dresser is a utility belt on top of a large cloth satchel. Asoka looks closer and gasps -- there are tiny beaver and sugar maple motifs, the style of their home Haven! Asoka reaches with their hand, then hesitates. 

Asoka: **"May I?"**

Serena: **"It's yours."**

### Page 8

Asoka lifts the jacket off the mannequin, reverently running their hands over the stitches, the weave, the hem. As Asoka does this, the cloth responds to their touch. 

Asoka: **"This is *beautiful*. Where did it come from?"**

Serena: **"Many years ago, your Green Haven Council visited us with this wooden dresser and a beautiful child's outfit made of the finest eSyrup cloth we've ever seen. They asked us to safeguard the outfit, and never show it to anyone, until a child with a mechapet begs us for sanctuary."**

Eireena: **"It's called *'cuttlefish cloth'* - this outfit can be 'voltage-treated' by your mechapet, but it will take some time for Iri to learn how to do it smoothly and reliably. The outfit will help you survive extreme temperatures, filter and purify the dirtiest water or air, and withstand an enormous amount of radiation. With practice, it can even camouflage its wearer *completely*, making you, more or less, *invisible*."**

Asoka: **"Just like Iri can do already!"**

Serena's eyes twinkle. 

Serena: **"And it's powered by your waste products."**

Asoka: **"Wait, what??"**

### Page 9

Serena's eyes never waver, face inscrutable. We see an image of an enormous network of neurons clinging to a decidedly less sexy set of intestines.

Serena: **"Everything that passes through your gut is processed by your [enteric nervous system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enteric_nervous_system), a network of *500 million* neurons - that's *5 times* as many as the neurons in your *spine*. You better respect what you eat, cuz now your guts also power your protective outfit."**

Serena grins now. 

Serena: **"Besides, the first outfit was for a little one just barely able to walk -- it needed to be a diaper too! It's basically a poop-powered safety bubble..."**

Asoka looks horrified. Eireena hides her smile. 

Eireena: **"*Anyways*, every year since then, your Council has visited us with a new outfit, and every year, they took back the old one."**

### Page 10

Asoka stares down at the cuttlefish cloth. 

Asoka: **"Did...the Beasts...attack my haven...because of *this*?"**

Asoka looks pained, eyes closed with guilt -- they are remembering the fangs, the impossibly fast movement, the sight of a delighted Pippa running down the mountainside towards death...Eireena places a hand on Asoka's shoulder, gentle but grim. 

Eireena: **"It's a heavy gift to bear. The one who wears this outfit will be the most anonymous, the most *free*, and the only one who has *any* chance of finding these people in the Amazon."**

*--end flashback--*

The flashback is interrupted by a loud **"CLANK"** from off-panel.

### Page 11

We're back in the bilge, where Asoka, who had been crying with pain and anger as their clenched fists crumple the last mouthful of the second potato, looks towards the source of the very loud clank with curiosity.

Asoka: *"Iri, was that you?"*

We see Iri, a flat blob with eyes, clinging invisibly to the ceiling of the command deck. Below Iri, Peacekeepers stand at workstations that look like wide, shallow metal dishes. Immediately underneath Iri, a white-haired woman wearing the insignia of the [Navigation Officer](http://navyformoms.ning.com/group/submoms/page/meet-the-crew-of-a-submarine) and a younger man wearing the insignia of an [Operations Specialist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_specialist_(United_States_Navy)) consult numerous hardcopy charts and plots, which to an untrained eye, look like nothing more than large pages covered a mess of lines and numbers. They hunch over the charts and plots in a most conspiratorial manner. 

Iri: *"Hmm? I've got an update on our location!"*

Asoka pulls the fabric of their face veil back across their face and pockets the crumpled balls of aluminum foil that once encased the throttle spuds. They then start to move across various pipes, staying out of the dirty water below, moving towards the sound of the loud clank. 

On Asoka's face veil, overlaid on top of Iri's view of the command deck, is the map that Asoka and Iri have been piecing together by stalking the navigation team throughout the trip. It shows the Americas, and a glowing blue line approximates the submarine's path down the eastern coast of North America. At the latitude of Gainesville, Florida, the line swings far out east into the ocean, to avoid the flooded remains of the Bahamas, the Turks and Caicos Islands, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, and the western most curve of the Caribbean Islands. Then the blue line hugs the coasts of Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, and finally, the Amapá state of Brazil, bordered to the southeast by a great river delta -- there the blue line becomes a tiny submarine made of light. That was their current location. 

### Page 12

Asoka carefully places their feet to turn a corner. They look up and gasp. 

Iri, off-panel: *"What? Did you find something?"*

We see Asoka's eyes, full of horror and terror. 

Asoka: *"Iri, look..."*

We zoom out to see before Asoka an enormous open space, lined with pipes and floor flooded with bilge water. On several large metal platforms, safely above the water level, is a pack of enormous, sleeping Beasts.

## Chapter 5: Lilacs Out Of The Dead Land

Character designs: Asoka Morei, Iri, Minka Oosou

### Chapter Title Page

**"Loading Universal Record..."**

**"Finished loading...'Planetside Environmental Report: The Red Zone'; [Classification: *Compartmented*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information#Typical_classification_levels)."**

**"The Red Zone was once called 'the tropics', a band of the Earth's surface bounded to the north by the Tropic of Cancer and to the south by the Tropic of Capricorn. Even in the heart of winter, 'the tropics' had over 10 hours of daylight, something that, at one time, made it irresistable to both colonists and retirees."**

**"They came for the clear blue waters full of iridescent fish and fascinatingly complex coral reefs; extravagant, multi-coloured birds-of-paradise and thrillingly powerful felines in enormous, lush forests; and rich soils teeming with plants that move and insects that wage war. But these [jewels of biodiversity](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2013/oct/23/new-species-amazon-rainforest-in-pictures) were far more delicate and fragile than they looked. By the time the Global Water Crisis hit, much of what made 'the tropics' so lovely and desirable was gone."**

**"For the next few decades, heavy downpours of acid rain drowned the beaches while boiling, humid heat tortured the dying forests. Atmospheric levels of CO2, NO2, and CH4 became toxic to most animals and plants. The tropics became a simmering, stinking hell, where along the coasts, deep layers of decaying plants sequestered nitrogen that the inland soil desperately needed..."**

### Page 1 

We see Asoka and Iri, shimmering with invisibility, looking back over a rocky outcrop to the north of the flooded, abandoned ruins of Manaus, full moon big in the night sky, as they head into the forest, quick and nimble, carrying only Asoka's cuttlefish-cloth satchel. Below, Peacekeepers dressed securely in full-body protective gear, breathing masks, goggles, and helmets, unload vehicles, supplies, and equipment from the amphibious vehicles shuttling everything from the submarine and set up a large, noisy, destructive camp on another outcropping along the north edge of the ruins. 

Asoka: *"Alright, 4 hours until sunrise..."*

### Page 2

Asoka stretches, trying to get rid of the stiffness of hiding in a bilge for over a week.

Iri: *"Yeah, warm up a bit first--"*

Asoka takes off running, Iri clinging to their neck for dear life. 

Asoka: *"No time for that, Iri!"*

Iri: *"You're gonna be sore as hell..."*

As Asoka runs, their face veil shows them overlays of annotations about the environment around them. This part of the forest is putrid and disgusting, everything rotten, dead, and sludgy. 

In addition the annotations about the flora around them, Asoka's face veil shows two temperature readings, one for the environment inside Asoka's clothes, and one for the outside environment. The outside temp is currently 36.2 deg celsius, while the temp inside Asoka's clothes is 23.1. 

Asoka's face veil also shows the atmospheric content in a dynamically changing pie chart. By the flooded ruins of Manaus, with its many dead trees and vegetation, [the methane content is very high](https://massivesci.com/articles/methane-trees-greenhouse-gas-wetlands/), much higher than CO2 and NO2 levels, which are also at fatally toxic levels (indicate with a color scale?). 

### Page 3

It's the earliest part of dawn - [astronomical dawn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawn#Astronomical_dawn). Asoka leans against a rock to catch their breath. A few scattered groves of [*Vismia guianensis*](https://cloudfront.escholarship.org/dist/prd/content/qt8xs2c9h8/qt8xs2c9h8.pdf?t=ovirno) trees break up the bleak landscape. 

Asoka: *"How...far...??"*

Asoka has pulled up their map onto their face veil. Iri places their location with a bright blue ball. 

Iri: *"There!"*

A bright blue ball appears, barely an eighth of the way to the blinking 'X'. Asoka gasps and shakes sweat into the cloth of their head scarf and face veil. The fabric gets damp, but then quickly dries, as if the cloth were drinking up the fluid. The outside temp now reads 39, while the temperature inside Asoka's outfit remains steady at 23. Methane levels have reduced a bit and are now just a little higher than CO2 and NO2 levels, which are lower than before but still at fatally toxic levels. 

Asoka: *"Seriously?? That's it??"*

Iri: *"Sokaaa, don't push yourself too much..."*

Asoka takes off their pack and pulls out a canteen of water. They guzzle the water through their face veil. They place their hand on their belly, and a view of their intestines shows up on their face veil. 

Asoka: *"Not empty yet..."*

Iri: *"But..."*

Zoom in on Asoka's eyes, fiercely determined. 

Asoka: *"We have to get there **first**, Iri!"*

### Page 4

It is now full and proper sunrise, the sun streaming horizontally between the scattered but significantly more dense trees. These trees are [pioneer species](http://blog.perunature.com/the-great-succession-epic-building-an-amazon-rainforest), fast-growing, sun-loving trees that can [replace the rainforest canopy](http://www.rainforestconservation.org/rainforest-primer/rainforest-primer-table-of-contents/f-forest-maintenance-and-succession/) and allow "climax species" to re-establish themselves in deforested regions. 

The outside temperature now reads 44.6 deg celsius, while the inside temperature has only gone up to 26.3 deg celsius. Methane levels now match CO2 and NO2 levels, which are now just above fatally toxic levels. 

Iri stares open mouthed at the jungle around them, as Asoka marvels at their outfit's range of protective abilities. 

Asoka: *"This is **beautiful**! How far are we now?"*

The bright blue ball has moved further north, a little past a quarter of the way to the 'X'. 

Iri gives Asoka a look. 

Iri: *"Maybe...you should eat soon?"*

Asoka: *"If you can find a cave? But I want to keep walking..."*

### Page 5

The sun is at its zenith. The air sizzles with heat, but Asoka and Iri are about to reach much denser tree cover. The re-growing forest here is dominated by [slower-growing pioneer species](https://e-reports-ext.llnl.gov/pdf/366224.pdf), including medicinal trees such as [*Vismia baccifera*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vismia_baccifera). 

Asoka quickly trudges into a dense grove, clearly uncomfortable and at the end of their strength. 

Iri: *"Wow, it is **hot!!!**"*

On Asoka's face veil, outside temperature reads 52.8 deg celsius, and the temperature inside their outfit now reads 27.7 deg celsius. A power guage icon flashes a gentle warning -- the outfit's power is low. Methane, CO2, and NO2 levels have dropped beneath 'fatally toxic', but the suit is unable to update the local atmospheric content in the grove due to its low power status. Asoka's eyes are heavy-lidded, and underneath, dark circles are quite visible.

Asoka: *"Where are we now?"*

The bright blue ball is now just about at the halfway point. Asoka collapses at the foot a tree, sitting in the largest patch of shade they can find, and pulls out their almost empty water canteen. They carefully pour water into their mouth through their face veil. 

Iri: *"You **have** to stay in the shade!"*

Asoka: *"Yeah? Ok...in that case..."*

Asoka immediately falls asleep where they sit. Iri dashes over and checks Asoka's vitals by running its arms along Asoka's outfit above their heart, lungs, stomach, and kidneys. As they do, the eSyrup cloth gives Iri readouts of each organs' functional well-being. Satisfied, Iri then starts to gather [Babassu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attalea_speciosa) palm leaves from the forest floor to make into a makeshift sun canopy. 

### Page 6

The sun is setting in the sky, deep red light rays cutting horizontally once more through the trees. Asoka is now sprawled on the ground, fully horizontal underneath Iri's makeshift sun canopy, which is large enough to cover Asoka's full body-length in shade. Several large leaves are drenched in water and wrapped around Asoka.  

*More references for pioneer species in the rainforest and forest restoration: https://globalforestatlas.yale.edu/amazon/conservation-initiatives/forest-restoration*

*More on plants native to the Amazon: http://www.pbs.org/journeyintoamazonia/plants.html*

Asoka suddenly jerks awake, eyes full of tears. 

Asoka: **"Pippa!"**

Asoka relaxes upon seeing Iri calmly standing watch. Asoka sits up, yawns, and streches, then gives Iri a gently accusing look through a face veil that shows the outside temperature to have dropped to 38.2 deg celsius, and Asoka's suit temperature is 23.0. Methane, CO2, and NO2 levels are characterised to be 'short-term breathable'. 

Asoka: *"You let me sleep more than a few hours."*

Iri hands Asoka their canteen. 

Iri: *"Drink. I found a stream nearby, and I already filtered and [UV-zapped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet_germicidal_irradiation) the water...I don't feel totally confident about my ability to reconfigure your face veil yet."*

Asoka: *"Thanks..."*

Asoka carefully opens the now completely full canteen and takes a long, grateful sip through their face veil. 

### Page 7

Iri: *"Also, Soka...look around you..."*

Asoka: *"Hmm?"*

Asoka runs their eyes over the trees around them and their face veil labels them as...

Asoka: *"[Papaya](https://www.instagram.com/p/BWs7J_xBYvP/)!"*

*More info on papaya: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papaya*

Asoka runs to the base of a papaya tree as Iri shimmies up the trunk. Iri brings down a large, bulbous fruit, and Asoka holds it reverently as their outfit scans the fruit to check its radiation content and ripeness. Simultaneously, Asoka's outfit checks the atmospheric content of the grove in which Asoka and Iri currently sit. Iri also takes in a huge breath of the air and does an independent analysis. 

Iri: *"Ok, I think the air in here is actually **breathable**!"*

Asoka tears off their face veil in order to ravenously tear into the papaya. Iri joyfully runs up the tree for more of the ripe fruits. 

Asoka: **"Mmmmmm!!!"**

### Page 8

Asoka has eaten their fill of papaya and now looks euphoric. They sprawl at the base of the papaya tree as nautical twilight descends on the forest. Fireflies blink in and out of the blue darkness. Iri cuddles their leg and looks up at Asoka. 

Iri: *"You know...it wasn't your fault."*

We see Asoka's fists clench for a moment. Then they resolutely wipe their mouth, abruptly focusing on the cooling night. They put on their face veil and see a view of the world showing the chemical exhalations and radiation signatures of the plants around them, enhancing their vision in the rapidly fading blue light. The outside temperature has now dropped to 35.1 deg celsius, and the temperature inside Asoka's suit is down to 22.5 deg C. Methane, CO2, and NO2 levels are safely within 'short-term breathable' levels. Asoka's face is grim, angry.

Asoka: *"Let's do this."*

Asoka crouches, ready to run. They are caught completely unawares by a blurry figure kicking them in the back of the head with a [Meia Lua de Compasso](https://youtu.be/IiLqVCyyoPs).  

The figure squeals with terror. 

Figure: **"Aaauuuuuuggh, é real!!!"**

*translation: "Aaauuuuuuggh, it's real!!!"*

### Page 9

Asoka's entire head scarf and veil have been kicked off entirely, and Asoka is frantically trying to put their head gear back on while hiding their face behind their arms and hair. Iri jumps up onto Asoka to cover their face with its body, becoming visible and puffing itself up as big as it can go, glowing an eery, ghostly white. Iri's belly, smashed up against Asoka's face, displays what Iri sees so that Asoka isn't left blind. 

The figure facing Asoka and Iri is small, dark-skinned, and dressed only in loose, flowing trousers that cinch at the knees and have large open slits down the sides. They crouch in battle-ready pose, menacing Iri with what looks like a short, broad spike of metal curved wickedly at its jagged end. Their eyes are tightly shut, yet they seem to know exactly where Iri seemingly floated above the forest floor. They are sweating and trembling with terror. 

Figure: **"Espírito maligno, fique longe de meus mamões!!"**

*translation: "Evil spirit, stay away from my papayas!!"*

Iri: *"They think we're an evil spirit?!"*

Asoka: **"No, I'm a human!"** 

Asoka holds up their invisible hands in surrender, completely forgetting their camouflage.

Iri: *"Not English, Portuguese!"*

The small dark figure rushes at Iri with a blood-curdling yell.

### Page 10

Asoka tries to dodge the dark figure's rush towards them as Iri hardens its arms to parry the metal spike, thrust at it by the dark figure. Undaunted, the dark figure twists their body to deliver an [escorpião kick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_capoeira_techniques#/media/File:Capoeira_Scorpion_kick.gif) and knocks Iri off of Asoka's face. Iri goes flying into a tree trunk and crumples at its base. Asoka, who has managed to get the head scarf back on but hasn't yet put up their face veil, completely forgets to hide their face and runs over to check on Iri. 

Asoka: **"Iri!!!"**

The dark figure now has an unobstructed view of Asoka's head, seemingly floating without any body attached to it. They *freak* out. 

Figure: **"Aaaaaaaahhhh!!"**

Iri is dazed but alright. They shakily climb up Asoka's arm onto their shoulders and places two arms over Asoka's ears. 

Iri: *"You need...Portuguese!"*

Asoka turns off their camou and now, finally fully visible, turns to the dark figure and puts both hands up in a gesture pleading for mercy. 

Asoka: **"Please! Eu sou humano!"**

*translation: "I'm human!"*

The dark figure, eyes still tightly closed, circles Asoka and Iri. They are clearly still terrified, but the hand holding the metal spike is steady. 

Figure: **"O que você quer??"**

*translation: "What do you want??"*

### Page 11

Asoka: **"Um exército está vindo para te matar!"**

*translation: "An army is coming to kill you!"*

Figure: **"Mentiroso!!"**

*translation: "Liar!!"*

Asoka: **"No! Por favor--"**

Suddenly Asoka notices the ground rumbling gently. 

Figure: **"O que é isso?"**

*translation: "What is it?"*

The rumbling gets louder, heavier, ominously closer. The figure has also noticed, and now looks in the direction of the rumbling, having seemingly lost all interest in Asoka and Iri. 

### Page 12

Figure: **"Merda--!!"**

*translation: "Shit--!!"*

Suddenly a tank plows through the grove of papaya trees, completely destroying everything in its path. Asoka, Iri, and the dark figure scream with terror and frantically get out of the way of the incoming stampede of military vehicles, which pay no mind to anything in their way, be it flora, fauna, or unusual, out-of-place humans and mechapet.

## Dream 2: Rites of Passage

### Page 1

Bonfires on a warm night. Shadows of well-choreographed ritual dancers, powerful and strong from a lifetime of training, hover warmly, protectively. The view is zoomed out so that we see Min (the dark figure from chapter 5) from above. Min is topless, sitting inside a large, fat metal hoop, a la Cyr Wheel. She is surrounded in many concentric circles of family and friends, all dressed in their most splendid clothing made of cloth in which the embroidery moves fluidly, in response to the lighting, the sounds, the wearers moods...

Drums beat in the background...

**"Another Tree Surfer is born tonight."**

Over this backdrop, small ghostly close-up panels are scattered, showing different parts of 16 year old Min, large swaths of skin covered in proudly displayed, ecstatically dancing clan tatoos:   
* an eye, nose, and ear. The eye is determined, steely, and dilated with adrenaline and euphoria. The nose and ear are pierced with eSyrup metal, formed into plain, elegantly raw shapes with rounded edges. The brow is set and only slightly sweaty. The head is shaved and covered in tatoos of her achievements as a clan member and Arborist. 
* a strong and straight back, dominated by an eSyrup tatoo depicting the night sky above the Amazon, with stars, planets, and Orbiter vessels.  
* shoulder and neck from the front, collar bone straight in a relaxed line that is perfectly parallel to the bottom edge of the panel. Neck is a bit clenched, and tendrils of Min's back tatoo curl around from her back in comforting, fractal patterns.  
* legs, covered in line art encoding her family lineage, are folded in an easy lotus, covered in the soft folds of ritual clothing appropriate for the ascent of a Journeyhume Arborist to the status of Expert Crafter: Tree Surfer. 

### Page 2

We see the people in the inner most circle, just on the outside of the metal hoop:  

* Jina, also covered in clan tatoos and splendid eSyrup ritual clothing. Jina's intradermal shield is visible in shadowy patterns under her clan tatoos. Next to her is a tall bucket holding ritual clensing water.  
* Amadou, no intradermal shield and just a few clan tatoos, but dressed spledidly and unspeakably proud of his daughter.   
* Majhee, matriarch leader of their clan, intradermal shield barely visible beneath the many clan tatoos. She is proud, stern, and exhuberant on this day of achievement by her granddaughter.  
* Maraba, Min's cousin and dearest childhood companion, now an Expert Inker and chosen for the honour of injecting Min's intradermal shield. Next to Maraba, in a shallow curving woven basket, is an enormous syringe full of swirling, bubbling, raw eSyrup, freshly harvested from one of their original, surviving cultures, called "Mothers". 

**"To be reborn, each Journeyhume must first retreat to one of the sacred caves and refrain from both food and speech for 7 days. The Clan joins them on the seventh day, when the Journeyhume must accept an injection of *raw eSyrup*."**

### Page 3

**"DOOOOHM!"** 

We see many concentric hands, surrounding this scene: Jina, Majhee, Amadou, and Maraba have stood and picked up the metal hoop. They hold it in place as Min steps onto the curving metal, hands pushing against the hoop above her head. 

Majhee and Amadou strap Min's ankles and wrists to the metal hoop as Jina pours the bucket of water slowly over Min. 

Min is drenched and Maraba has positioned the needle of the syringe full of raw eSyrup against Min's right buttcheek. Maraba slowly injects all of the eSyrup as Min grits her teeth. Jina has returned the bucket to its previous location in the circle. 

We see raw eSyrup spreading throughout Min's body, moving up her torso, across her arms and legs, over her face, and into her eyelids. Min's has cousin pulled out the syringe and placed it back on the basket. 

**"The raw eSyrup is engineered to look for radioactive proteins that mark the cells of the [ectoderm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ectoderm), the outermost layer the human embryo. Every Automata born in the Red Zone has lifelong tags on the cells of their skin, hair, nails, eyes, teeth, sinuses, and nervous system."**

### Page 4

As the intradermal shield continues into her mouth, nose, and sinuses, Min begins to cough and gag. The crowd chants **"Seja livre! Seja LIVRE! SEJA LIVRE!"** as Min finishes integrating the intradermal shield. 

*translation: "Be free! Be FREE! BE FREE!"*

After a tense moment, Min focuses her intradermal awareness to sprout razor sharp spikes at her wrists and ankles, cutting her bonds. The crowd roars with triumph.

### Page 1

Min peers after the rampaging military tanks, standing confidently at the tippy top of one of the few tall trees in the area, giving her a bird's eye view across the scant and scraggly canopy. Min's eyelids are shut, the thin skin full of eSyrup-infected cells. Through those cells are filtered just enough energy for Min's eyes, safely behind the lids, to see. A brisk wind ruffles her mohawk. 

Min's skin has a distinctive metallic and shiny quality right now - her full intradermal shield is activated. Her mouth is set in an unhappy grimace the intradermal shield at her ears and temple glow. 

Min: *"They're making a bee line for [Gruta de Judeia](https://goo.gl/maps/v8ocpUS8njq)!"*

### Page 2

Nicola Cavalcanti is sitting on a tree platform, somewhere far to the west, in a much quieter and relatively healthy-looking part of the forest. She seems to be stargazing, staring adoringly at the sky...with eyes tightly shut. Her ears and temple are also glowing, and her skin is also metallic and shiny all over.  

Nicola Cavalcanti: *"Lovely...50 years, and they really **haven't** changed their satellite sensors..."*

Min: *"We were right!"*

Nicola: *"Does this mean you'll come home now?"*

Min: *"Not until I get an **apology**! Why am I the only one who has to **prove** that my First Quest is **necessary**?"*

Nicola: *"Do you really think anyone's going to give you an apology?"*

Min: *"Since when is 'The First Quest shall be of the Reborn's choosing' a confusing statement??"*

### Page 3

Nicola stands and stretches on the tree platform, which is just big enough for her to stand shoulder width apart and still have about 10cm from her feet to the edge. 

Nicola: *"The Elders weren't wrong. It's a big risk to take, and there's no 'undo' button. What's the damage to our groves out there?"*

Min: *"Don't change the subject! Why didn't you say anything to defend me?"*

Nicola stretches in a deep downward dog, reveling in the pose and wiggling with pleasure. 

Nicola: *"Why did you run away instead of fighting for what you believe in?"*

Nicola's ears and temple abruptly stop glowing. She calmly goes into a [tucked handstand](https://youtu.be/XTEfIPjUuLo) on the tree platform, eyes still tightly closed. 

### Page 4

Min, ears and temple also no longer glowing, climbs down from the canopy. Below her, Asoka clings to the trunk of the tree and Iri clings to Asoka. Two of Iri's arm tips are over Asoka's ears. Asoka calls up to Min. 

Asoka: **"*We have to hurry! They'll get to your village by morning!!*"**

Min tilts her head to the side, looking down at Asoka with curiosity. 

Min: **"You don't look like an Orbiter..."**

A dark rage suddenly flares up on Asoka's face. 

Asoka: **"*I'm not one of them! My name is Asoka Morei, and I'm a Biononymous of Green Haven Howes!*"**

### Page 5

*--flashback--*

Asoka clutches Iri, frozen on the steep path as they stare down the mountainside at a huge swarm of enormous, blurry, bloody, furry, four-legged creatures, distant screams floating up the mountainside like smoke...

Iri/João: **"It's the **BEASTS**!! Run Soka! *RUN!!*"**

Iri tries to get Asoka to look at it, to stop, as Asoka, eyes wide with terror and shock, slowly steps down the mountain.

Asoka: **"*Dad*..."**

Iri/João: **"Asoka! Pay attention!"**

Asoka: **"Where are you? Where's mom?"**

Iri grabs Asoka's face and forces them to look straight into the cuttlefish's eyes. 

Iri/João: **"Asoka! They've already sealed the cave entrance! *Get to the next Hav*--aauucchhh!"**

Suddenly Iri spins away from Asoka, as if slashed by invisible claws. Asoka screams, arms reaching for Iri. 

Asoka: **"*Noooo!*"***

### Page 6

Asoka is running down the mountainside, dodging trees and bushes while carrying Iri in their arms. Iri's eyes are rolling back into their heads and they look ashen. Asoka's eyes are frantic. 

Suddenly someone crashes into Asoka. Asoka manages to roll while holding onto Iri protectively. Asoka looks up and sees a Biononymous adult in full outfit. Asoka opens their mouth to ask what's going on, and the Biononymous adult covers Asoka's mouth through Asoka's face veil. The Biononymous adult, looking distraught, touches forheads with Asoka and grimaces. Then the adult gets close to Asoka's ear and whispers intently. 

Biononymous adult: **"*Run to the next Haven! Don't let the Beasts see you!!*"**

The Biononymous adult quickly turns Asoka around and shoves them back into the thicket, then runs off in the opposite direction, yelling and loudly crashing through the forest. 

### Page 7

Asoka turns around just in time to see an enormous furry *thing*, blurrily crashing through the bushes and lift a giant paw, claws bared, over the attention-stealing Biononymous adult. 

The Beast brings down its paw in a ferocious slash. The Biononymous adult cries in agony, bleeding profusely from enormous cuts running across their back, unable to run any further. 

Asoka is running and can't help looking back over their shoulder. We see the Beast open a hellish mouth of fangs, grab the Biononymous adult in its powerful jaws, and shake the limp body back and forth violently. 

*--end flashback--**

### Page 8

Back in the Amazon, up in the tree with Min. Min is no longer grinning. Asoka is looking up at Min, tears streaming down their face. 

Asoka: **"*That's why we have to hurry!!*"**

Min squats and stares down the approximately 5 meters of tree trunk down at Asoka's face veil, her eyes sad, her mouth angry. 

Min: **"There is no village. 'The Clan is fluid upon the land'...it's just a decoy."**

Asoka: **"*Wha--what?*"**

Min: **"The Peacekeepers will find the remains of a beautiful waterfall, which they'll totally fail to appreciate..."**

Asoka: **"*But...they said they have satellite images of people living there!*"**

Min grins with vengeful glee down at Asoka. 

Min: **"Ha! We totally fooled them!!"**

Asoka: **"*Then the Biononymous need your help!*"**

### Page 9

The scene has transitioned to the Central Hearth of the Automata campsite, an tree-house-like structure made from a single, giant eSyrup-bubble. The sun above is not quite at its zenith. Min and Asoka stand before a crowd of Automata, both children and Elders, members of the Automata clan who have all received their intradermal shield and successfully returned to the Amazon forest after spending at least a year living in the Underground Cities to the south of the Red Zone. Asoka holds their head scarf and face veil nervously in front of them, anxiously glancing at Min for cues, not used to being bare-faced in front of so many strangers, but wanting to make a good first impression. Iri sits on Asoka's shoulders, arms wrapped protectively around Asoka's head and neck. Elders look troubled or curious, or a torn mixture of both. Children openly stare at Iri, and at Asoka's unfamiliar clothing. Many of the Automata carry small monkeys, birds, or lizards on their person, docile animals perched on shoulders, curled around necks, or clinging to heads. 

Min addresses Nova Jatobá, currently serving as Head Councilor of Elders, around whom the curious crowd has gathered. 

Min: **"Eu solicito um conselho pelos Anciãos, para considerar esta aliança com os Biononymous, e reconsiderar minha primeira missão!"**

*translation: "I request a Council of the Elders, to consider this alliance with the Biononymous, and reconsider my First Quest!"*

Nova raises an eyebrow. 

Nova: **"Está tão ansioso por violência em nome de um povo muito longe para ver, ouvir ou tocar?"**

*translation: "Are you so eager for violence in the name of a people too far away to see, hear, or touch?"*

Min, furious, gets right in Nova's stony face, and throws her arm towards Asoka. 

Min: **"Não entende?? Outros também conseguiram voltar à superfície!"**

*translation: "Don't you understand?? Others have also made it back to the surface!"*

Murmurs of surprise, shock, and wonder ripple through the crowd. Nova, unmoved, folds her arms.

Off-panel: **"Aiii, Minkinha, quando você vai aprender *um pouco de paciência*?"**

*translation: "Aiii, little Minka, when will you learn **a little bit of patience**?"*

Majhee Suh, soon to be in her 90s, pushes her way through the crowd to the front. She is tiny, wrinkled, and no longer able to climb trees, but her back is still straight, and she eyes her granddaughter with laser-beam eyes. Min turns to her grandmother in desperation.

Min: **"Avó Majhee, este é o neto de Iúna Morei, Mama Bird!!"**

*translation: "Grandma Majhee, this is the grandchild of Iúna Morei, the legendary Mama Bird!!"*

Majhee turns to Asoka and lets her stern look soften into a delighted grin below twinkling eyes. 

Majhee: **"Oh meu...! Entou, primeiro nós comemos. Ninguém pode pensar com o estômago vazio!"**

*translation: "Oh my...! So, first we eat. No one can think with an empty stomach!"*

### Page 10

Asoka, Iri still tucked into their neck, has been seated next to Min on floor mats in front of a low table piled high with more food than Asoka has seen in weeks. On Asoka's other side, Majhee looks over the Central Hearth with a look of deep contentment. It's midday, and bright natural light floods the Central Hearth, but the temperature is comfortable. Overhead, an enormous eSyrup bubble protects the Central Hearth from the harsh sun and poisonous air, like a giant cell membrane. The day's cooking crew has just brought out the last of the serving plates, piled high with steaming hot food that makes Asoka's salivation response go wild. Asoka's face veil annotates the many strange fishes, vegetables, fruit, and grain laid out in lavish display. 

We see Nicola Cavalcanti carrying out the last trays of [escabeche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escabeche) made with [tambaqui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tambaqui), and behind her, another elder, [one of the few men with white hair and wrinkles](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/jan/29/men-cancer-deaths-greater-women), carries out large bowls full of [kkakdugi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kkakdugi). Nicola throws Min a wink as she passes. 

At one end of the Central Hearth is a large stone basin. On either side of the spigot coming out of the stone basin, 2 lines of Automata Elders wait their turn to fill large metal bowls with the rapidly flowing and high pressure water from the spigot. Each of these Elders have a long, folded piece of beautiful pale blue cloth folded over one shoulder. 

As the last serving bowl is placed on the tables, a hush falls over the Central Hearth. Asoka, eager to start eating, looks around in confusion, then hesitantly starts to reach for a bowl of rice. Min slaps down Asoka's hand. 

Min: **"Ainda não!"**

*translation: "Not yet!"*

### Page 11

A large gong rings. Asoka looks up towards one end of the Central Hearth to see that each Elder has folded their blue cloth into an [origami flower bowl](http://www.origami-instructions.com/origami-rose-bowl.html), which is secured to the top of a large pitcher. They then stand and pour their bowl of water carefully into the eSyrup cloth flower bowl, which filters and cleans the water as it passes through the bottom layer of cloth and into the pitcher. 

Asoka's face veil annotates the temperature of the aquifer's enormous rock wall to be 7.2 deg celsius. 

Over the above is the following dialogue: 

Asoka: **"*Quem são eles?*"**

*translation: "Who are they?"*

Min watches one Water Cycler in particular -- her gene mother Jina, daughter of Majhee Suh and Vec Barbosa, easily one of the most strikingly dramatic in physique out of the Automata -- with proud reverence.

Min: **"Eles são os *cicladores de água*."**

*translation: "They are the **water cyclers**."*

Min: **"Todos os dias eles [tratam a água](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_purification#Treatment) coletamos da chuva, do rio e de [nosso esgoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reclaimed_water)."**

*translation: "Every day, they [treat the water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_purification#Treatment) we collect from the coastal rains, from the [underground rivers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamza_River), and from [our sewage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reclaimed_water)."*

Asoka: **"*Espere, o que??*"**

*translation: "Wait, what??"*

### Page 12

The Water Cyclers have all poured their bowls of water into the enormous pitchers. They detach the origami flower bowl from the pitcher and in one confident, practiced shake, release the cloth from its shape. They then fold the cloth neatly and place it back on one shoulder.

Min: **"Você não ouviu? Nós tivemos uma crise da água. Cada gota é preciosa."**

*translation: "Didn't you hear? We had a Water Crisis. Every drop is precious."*

The Water Cyclers have each brought their pitcher to a table and poured themselves a glass. They all raise their glasses together.

Water Cyclers: **"Beber sem sangrar!"**

*translation: "To drink without bleeding!"*

The Water Cyclers then all down their glass of water. The gathered Automata start to clap and cheer and eat and drink. Min grins and reaches for the escabeche. 

Min: **"Certo, *agora* podemos comer."**

*translation: "Ok, **now** we can eat."*

Asoka looks at the happy people, warm food, families and children laughing in the sunlight, and they burst into tears, burying their face in their hands. Iri wraps its arms around Asoka tenderly as Majhee gently rubs Asoka's back.

**"The [Legged Squad Support System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legged_Squad_Support_System), or LS3, was a military project by the former United States of America during the early 21st century, with the goal of creating legged robots that could function as autonomous packhorses for land-based military operations. Inital work on this concept between 2009 and 2015 resulted in important insights about autonomous robotic technology, but the robots created at the time were deemed too noisy, too challenging to repair in the field, and unsuitable for integration into traditional military operational structures."**

**"67 days ago..."**

It is the night of Min's Rite of the Mothers. Min has just used her intradermal shield for the first time to cut her bonds and is lying on the ground, curled in a fetal position inside the giant metal hoop and nursing bleeding wrists and ankles. She is surrounded by Majhee, Jina, Amadou, and Maraba; beyond the inner circle, the rest of the Clan waits to hear Min's first words as a Reborn. 

Majhee: **"Minka Oosou, filha de Jina e Amadou, surfista de árvore para os Autômatos!"**

*translation: "Minka Oosou, daughter of Jina and Amadou, Tree Surfer of the Automata!"*

View of Min from the front, gasping, blinking away large beads of sweat from her eyes as she looks up at her grandmother.  

Majhee's eyes, proud, confident, expectant: **"*O que significa ser livre?*"**

*translation: "What does it mean to be free?"*

Min closes her eyes, tries to calm her breathing, and struggles to stand. 

Min: **"Beber sem sangrar, respirar sem engasgar, ver o céu e saudar o dia em minha própria pele..."**

*translation: "To drink without bleeding, to breathe without choking, to see the sky and greet the day in my own skin..."*

Min: **"...e MOVER em qualquer direção com curiosidade e graça..."**

*translation: "...and to MOVE in any direction with curiosity and grace..."*

Zoom in on Min's mouth, exhausted yet serene, confident, and defiant.

Min: **"...mesmo FORA DO PLANETA!"**

*translation: "...even OFF THE PLANET!"*

### Page 2

We're back to the day when Asoka meets the Automata Clan. The feast is over, and the tables have been cleared. The crowd in the Central Hearth ranges from babes-in-arms to silver haired grandmothers, but most of the Elders are clustered towards the center. Asoka, face still streaked with tear-marks but composure regained, is sitting at the edge of the crowd and letting Mahjee comb their hair. A small crowd of Automata children have gathered around Iri and are watching the mechapet morph shape and colour with gleeful awe. 

The sun is just past midday. Min is standing with her hand on a waist-high pedestal, made of an enormous [amythest quartz geode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amethyst), blue-purple crystals exposed at the top section under Min's hand. The eSyrup bubble overhead shows Min's canopy-top POV of the Peacekeepers destructive rampage through the delicate re-growing forest last night. Jina and a heavily-muscled dark man sit close to Min. The man is Min's gene father Amadou, and his back, like Min, is covered in a star field tattoo. Many of the Elders wince at the show of thoughtless destruction being shown above. Nicola sits near Min and the pedestal, and addresses the Central Hearth. 

Nicola: **"Based on the Council's recommendation, I helped Min set up a modified Bubble at Gruta de Judeia, one that would show Orbiter satellite surveillance systems a false glimpse of human activity in that area. Given our lack of current information on the Orbiters, this seemed a fair test of their intentions."**

Nicola looks up at the video playing on the eSyrup bubble overhead. 

Nicola: **"I think it's safe to say, their intentions are not harmless, nor are they thoughtful."**

### Page 3

An older man, watching the video on the eSyrup bubble with arms crossed and a deep frown on his face, snorts derisively and crosses his arms. 

Older man: **"Hard to dispute that. But according to Asoka, the Orbiters *are* clever, and willing to be brutal. If they're willing to deploy an entire regiment of military idiots in less than a month, based on some blurry satellite images...what might they do if they realise that one of the 'magical tree people' from the Red Zone..."**

He turns hard eyes to Min. 

Older man: **"...has conveniently brought herself into orbit, where they can easily capture her?"**

Min opens her mouth indignantly, but Jina cuts in first. 

Jina: **"Osiel, you should know that no child of mine would be so easy to catch!"**

A ripple of laughter runs through the Central Hearth, lightening the mood. Jina winks at Min, who gives Jina a look of fierce adoration. Osiel smiles grimly. 

Osiel: **"I'm more worried about how Min will infiltrate a society that surveils and documents literally *everything*. While I can think of a dozen ways to stay off the Orbiters' radar, none of them include 'apply to their most prestigious school for space exploration, where even apprentices have access to cutting-edge Orbiter tech'."**

### Page 4 

Min removes her hand from the amethyst pedestal, ending the video playback up on the bubble ceiling, and folds her arms in exasperation. 

Min: **"That's why I'll first build up a fake Universal Record! Amadou's old contacts in [Sumaq Urqu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerro_Rico) can help--"**

Osiel loses his temper and throws up a hand towards the bubble ceiling. 

Osiel: **"How can you be so naive, even after seeing that? If you're caught, you won't just get thrown out of school -- the World Government will dissect you to learn the secrets of your intradermal shield!"**

Concerned murmurs run through the Central Hearth. Min takes a step towards Osiel, full of indignation. 

Min: **"That's *if* I get caught!"**

A female elder named Terena quirks her eyebrow at Min. 

Terena: **"So how will you avoid it?"**

Amadou raises a finger and smiles. 

Amadou: **"It's called a 'liquid [MOSFET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOSFET) [sievert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sievert) shield'."**

### Page 5

The sun is setting in the sky, and everyone looks exhausted.

Nova: **"It seems our consensus is building towards moving our re-forestation efforts away from Manaus and Gruta Judeia for at least a year, and keeping the movements of the Central Hearth to the west of the [Rio Negro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Negro_(Amazon)). I'd like to hear from any Elders whose feelings remain incompatible with this decision."**

The gathered Elders are all silent. Nova looks around the Central Hearth and clucks with satisfaction. 

Nova: **"Concerning the fate of our visitor, Asoka Morei, our consensus seems to be building towards letting them stay with us for as long as they wish, under the condition that they will remain a child in the eyes of the Automata -- Asoka will never be eligible to receive a intradermal shield, nor to block a consensus of the Elders. Are there any Elders whose feelings remain incompatible with this decision?"**

The gathered Elders are again all silent, many turning to look at Asoka, who is still sitting at the edge of the Central Hearth. Asoka, hair now braided into a neat, pretty crown, with Iri in their lap, looks a little embarrased by the attention but relieved.  Min is watching Amadou, who looks a bit sad and distant. Jina gives Asoka a smile, but there is the tiniest hint of pity in her smile. Asoka glances at Majhee, who gives them a huge, warm smile of encouragement. 

Nova now sighs. 

Nova: **"Concerning the alliance with the Biononymous, our consensus seems to be building towards rejecting the alliance for now, until we learn more about the Orbiters. Towards this end, in one moon's time Minka will present a detailed plan for her First Quest, to learn more about the Orbiters at one of their schools. I do not agree but I will stand aside. Are there any Elders whose feelings remain incompatible with this decision?"**

Osiel looks unsatisfied, but most of the Elders look relieved that the consensus has ended up the way it did. Again, everyone is silent. Nova nods, clearly eager to wrap things up. Min and Amadou exchange a look of joyful triumph, and even as Jina clutches Amadou's hand with apprehension, she also gives Min a radiantly proud smile. 

Nova: **"Very well, we have reached consensus. Thank you everyone for your time. We'll be moving out in the morning."**

Asoka watches Min celebrate the Elders' final decision with Jina and Amadou. As Asoka hugs Iri, their eyes fill with tears again. 

### Page 6

**"One week later: near the entrance to [Abismo Guy Collet](https://www.wondermondo.com/abismo-guy-collet/)"**

The late morning sun filters into Asoka's sleeping bubble, a private eSyrup structure suspended in a tree at the edge of a [tepui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tepui) in the [Serra do Aracá](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serra_do_Aracá_State_Park), [looking out over the re-growing Amazon rainforest below](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tepui#/media/File:TepuiRio.jpg). Asoka's red hair, splayed out on the pillow in their eSyrup hammock, glistens in the bright light. Iri is splayed out on top of Asoka's chest, snoring peacefully. Asoka's jacket, head scarf, and face veil hang on the tree trunk next to one of the hammock's anchor points. On the massive tree branch extending out underneath Asoka's hammock, Asoka's boots and socks are neatly placed, just underneath the jacket and head gear. Asoka's gloves are tucked into the jacket pockets, fabric fingers curling over the edge of the pocket openings. On another hook on the main trunk, on the other side of Asoka's hammock anchor, is a cloth water canteen. A spiral staircase is carved into the main trunk, leading in one direction down to the Central Hearth, and in the other, all the way to the top of the tall canopy tree. 

Asoka eyes are open, and they stare emotionlessly at the fractal patterns of tree branches above their hammock, dappled light softened by the filtration of their sleeping bubble. 

Asoka: *"...Pippa..."*

A brief flash of memory: Pippa and Manut, running down the mountainside.

Asoka's eyes fill with tears. 

Asoka: *"...why did I send you back?"*

### Page 7

Asoka hears a muffled voice call through their eSyrup bubble. 

Min: **"Asoka?"**

Asoka doesn't move. 

Min: **"Asoka, I'm coming in!"**

Min steps through the bubble membrane. Iri discreetly places their arms over Asoka's ears and turns their head towards Min obligingly. 

Min: **"Almoço?"**

*translation: "Lunch?"*

Asoka doesn't move or answer. Iri chirps worriedly at Asoka, then looks at Min apologetically. 

Iri: **"Maybe...not today..."**

Min: **"Don't be ridiculous. You skipped yesterday also."**

Asoka still doesn't answer. Min attempts to be funny. 

Min: **"I'm not always happy about the Elders' decision either, but don't let their farts kill your appetite."**

No response from Asoka. After a long awkward pause, Min is unable to think of what to do. 

Min: **"Ok, well...I'll come back later then..."**

### Page 8

It's late afternoon, almost sunset. Asoka is sitting up in their hammock and drinking from the cloth water canteen that had been hanging by their hammock. Asoka is so weak that Iri must help hold up the canteen, which is getting empty. A pile of papayas have appeared next to the hammock. 

Iri: *"You have to get out of bed..."*

Asoka starts to cry again. Their stomach rumbles loudly, pityingly, and Iri looks exasperated. 

Iri: *"Soka, eat something, please??"*

Suddenly, the trees are full of rambunctious Automata children and many of their [animal companions](http://www.srl.caltech.edu/personnel/krubal/rainforest/Edit560s6/www/animals.html). They are chase each other through the branches as they pass a [peteca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peteca) back and forth, reveling in the twists and jumps and turns they are able to incorporate into their movement. Amongst them is Min, who hits the peteca with a [Meia Lua de Compasso](https://youtu.be/IiLqVCyyoPs), foot making solid impact with the weighted fabric bottom, one hand on a tree trunk and body practically horizontal while mid-air. Wrapped and secured to Min's back is a large [bojagi](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bojagi).

A very tiny Automata child, a tiny [squirrel monkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_squirrel_monkey) deftly clinging to his shoulder, shrieks with excitement as the peteca comes towards him. He eyeballs the peteca like a hawk, his gaze never wavering. He winds up his arm, ready to smack the peteca back towards Min...and just as he hits the flying packet of feathers, he takes one too many steps backwards and throws himself backwards off the tree branch. 

Automata child: **"Aaaaaaaaaahaahahahahahahaha!"**

The tiny Automata child lands on top of Asoka's sleeping bubble with a gelatinous bounce. The whole bubble ripples but holds its shape. The child, exhilerated from the game and his fall, falls back into the eSyrup bubble stomach first, gasping with laughter and exertion as he looks happily down at Asoka and waves. The monkey on his shoulder chirps and turns its head in a hilarious caricature of curiosity. Asoka stares back, hunger and crushing depression momentarily forgotten. 

Automata child: **"You're Min's evil spirit! We brought you food!"**

Asoka and Iri exchange a glance, then Asoka sighs and ties back their hair. 

Asoka: *"Fine, I'll get up."*

### Page 9

We see a view from above, of Asoka and Min sitting across from each other on the large tree trunk beneath Asoka's hammock. Asoka is bare-headed and wearing only their sleeveless undershirt and trousers. Between the two teens is a large, mouth-watering [dosirak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dosirak) of leftovers from the Central Hearth, sitting on top of the bojagi that Min had used to bring it up to Asoka's bubble. Asoka unenergetically picks at the food as Min pours from a tall thermos of sweet juice made from [Ungurahua](https://youtu.be/baWFekERwsw) fruit into several wooden cups. The tiny Automata child that fell onto Asoka's sleeping bubble, monkey companion now perched on his head, holds out a cup of the fruit juice to Iri.  

Automata child: **"Wanna try?"**

Iri carefully tips a small amount of liquid into its mouth. Its eyes light up -- Iri likes the juice a lot! Iri downs the rest of the glass. Seeing Iri's enthusiastic response, Mawé puffs up pride. The little squirrel monkey cautiously approaches Iri, wanting to make friends. 

Iri: **"Mmmmmm!!"**

Min: **"Mawé helped me make it...it's [patua juice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oenocarpus_bataua)!"**

Mawé squeels with delight as Iri suddenly glows for a moment in response to the unfamiliar drink; at the same time, Asoka's clothing also briefly flash a new pattern, looking like a fractal tangle of blood vessels. Startled, the monkey rushes back onto Mawé's head, chittering and scolding everyone loudly. Asoka, watching Mawé and the monkey play with Iri, is suddenly and painfully reminded of Pippa. Asoka chokes up with sudden tears. 

Through their tears, Asoka sees a cup of patua juice, held out by small but strong hands. Asoka looks up to see an unexpectedly solemn Mawé, monkey now calm and peering at Asoka with intensity.   

Mawé: **"When I'm having a bad day, patua juice makes my luck better."**

Asoka stares at Mawé, still seeing a ghost of Pippa on the eager young face. After a moment, Mawé looks questioningly at Min. Min gently takes one of Asoka's hands and wraps it around the cup. 

### Page 10

Asoka blushes, embarrassed by the kind treatment. 

Asoka: **"Sorry...I mean, thanks, I could use some better luck..."**

Min's hand stays on Asoka's to give it a strong, warm squeeze. 

Min: **"You're far from home, surrounded by strange people and things...I think you're handling it super well."** 

Asoka's eyes fill with tears. 

Asoka: **"But I asked for it...I said I don't care if the worst happens!"**

Asoka grits their teeth and hides their face in their hands, as tears begin to spill out of their eyes. Iri crawls into Asoka's lap and gently strokes Asoka's hands with its arms, trying to calm Asoka. 

Asoka: **"I said I could handle it...but I really can't!!"**

Asoka starts to rock back and forth, feeling as if their pent-up emotions might tear them apart, cell by cell. Min crawls around the food to kneel by Asoka. Mawé also moves closer, wide-eyed. 

Min: **"Hey...do you want a hug?"**

Asoka doesn't look up, but gives a tiny nod. Iri gives Min an encouraging smile and moves to Asoka's shoulder. 

Asoka, barely audible: **"*Yes...*"**

Min embraces Asoka gently, tentatively. Asoka turns their face into Min's chest and begins to cry loudly, in heaving sobs. Min's eyes start to also fill with tears, and the two teens cry and hold each other. Mawé puts his tiny arms around both Min and Asoka, dry eyed and confused by the older children's emotions but willing to accept that both babies and grownups seem incredibly susceptible to tears, especially when compared to the stable composure and infinite wisdom that seem to bless 7 year olds. Mawé's monkey chirps gently, and Iri's arms gently cradle all three childrens' heads. 

### Page 11

The sun has set. A fantastic view of the nighttime forest is lit by a full moon. Above is the night sky, resplendent with stars and the un-twinkling lights of planets and Orbiter vessels. Below, in a large tree with generous branches, is an eSyrup bubble. Inside, Iri sits on top of Asoka's head, and Mawé is fast asleep with his head in Min's lap. The squirell monkey is sprawled hilariously on its back, safely held in Mawé's arms. Asoka and Iri look up around them with wonder and awe on their faces. Min is entranced by the flow of soft yet brilliant colors gently pulsating across Iri and Asoka's clothing. 

Min: **"So, instead of an intradermal shield, you use cuttlefish cloth and mechapets?"**

Asoka fondles a corner of their outfit, face sad but also proud as they fondly scratch Iri above its eye ridges. 

Asoka: **"Yeah...both Iri and I are connected to the outfit, so the cloth also connects us. We're still learning how to control the cloth, just like how it takes you a while to learn how to control your shield."**

Min reverently touches the cloth near Asoka's hand. 

Min: **"You were able to hide from the World Government, even while stowing away on a *submarine*..."**

Min makes a determined fist and looks up at Asoka, grinning widely. 

Min: **"If you could pull that off, then I know I can figure out a way to get into the ISE Corps!!"**

Asoka: **"The ISE Corps?"**

Min laughs with delight as her mohawk flutters in the gentle wind inside the bubble. She looks up with unbridled adoration at the bright, untwinkling lights of Orbiter vessels up in the night sky. 

Min: **"The International Space Exploration Corps...usually only for Orbiters...but a few years ago they started a 'Space Asylum Program', a scholarship for Earthers."**

Min now locks eyes with Asoka. 

Min: **"I'm gonna become the greatest space swimmer the ISE has ever seen. And if I graduate in the top ten, I'll get a free ride to Space University!"**

### Page 12

Asoka looks down at Mawé and squirell monkey, sleeping so peacefully in Min's lap, face full of fear.  

Asoka: **"But...what if you fail, or get caught? What if the World Government tries to wipe out the Automata, like they're trying to do to the Biononymous?"**

Min looks down at Mawé and gently cups his little chubby face. 

Min: **"Avó Majhee told me that regrowing the [Amazonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_rainforest) will take a long, *long* time...but if we don't do it, humans will never reclaim the surface."**

Min looks up at Asoka with a determined look on her face.

Min: **"The Automata *have* to survive, and what I learn from the Orbiters will help us. But we can't do it alone...the Biononymous must *also* survive!"**

Asoka looks up at the stars, chewing on Min's words. After a moment, Min face softens and she leans back, turning her gaze back up to the stars. She speaks in fierce whisper.

Min: **"Who are the Orbiters to keep us here while they fly free? They made a mess of this planet and left us to clean it up, so space is just as much ours as it is theirs!"**

Asoka: **"You're right..."**

Asoka turns to Min, a fire suddenly alight in their eyes. 

Asoka: **"...we'll *all* make it, and anyone who tries to stop us..."**

Asoka clasps Min on the shoulder as Min grins back at them. 

Asoka: **"...will only make us stronger!"**

## Dream, the last: Comma, not a Period

### Page 1

The Automata have gathered to say goodbye to Min. Today, she leaves for her Year Underground. Min is dressed in lightweight travel gear and has a substantial pack strapped to her back. Pinned to Min's clothing and pack are flowers, leaves, tiny delicate knotwork for good fortune, and other small trinkets of affection and remembrance. Maraba adjusts a good luck knot in Min's hair and gives Min a huge, albeit teary, grin. Amadou kneels to be face to face with his rather short daughter. His eyes are full of tears, and he opens his mouth to speak, but then finds that he cannot. Instead, he pulls Min into a huge bear hug. Father and daughter embrace fiercely. Amadou kisses Min on the forehead, then stands as Min turns to hug Jina, just as fiercely. Min then tenderly hugs Majhee, who chuckles and shoos Min along the line of well-wishers.

### Page 2

Asoka stands towards the end of the line, trying to look happy but unable to hide their deep, cutting sadness. They keep their eyes down as Min approaches them; Asoka is the last to say goodbye. Asoka holds out in one hand the tiny origami dragon folded from a delicate piece of eSyrup cloth that they made as their parting gift. With the other hand, they stroke the dragon's spine -- it yawns and stretches, like a tiny folded lizard-cat made of living cloth. Min's eyes widen with delight - she's never seen such a tiny, delicate origami dragon before. 

Min reverently places the little origami dragon her shoulder, where it circles a few times then settles onto its haunches, fluttering its wings a bit with pleasure at its new vantage point. 

Min looks up at the crying Asoka, who is trying hard to smile through their tears. Min grins. 

Min: **"Don't you slack on your [capoeira](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capoeira) training!"**

Asoka and Min clasp hands as Asoka returns Min's grin, matching her fierceness with their own.

Asoka: **"*In 2 years, you won't even recognize me in the roda!*"**

Min throws back her head in a full-throated laugh.

Min: **"Deal! See you in orbit!"**

## Epilogue

*When our minds began to shape,  
faced an unknown landscape  
full of fatal fruits,  
but we moved, cuz that's what living things do;  
yeah we groove and we rise  
to unchain our minds from the vines of the vices of the status quo.*  

*They don't wanna free our minds,  
they want obedient drones  
who will labor  
for the myth of a rich man's favour,  
'stead of lovin' their neighbor;  
we all long to belong,  
sing along, harmonies of all the same song.*  

*--T. Sorriso  
From "Heartsongs of the [Vigilante Intergalactic Roustabout Scholars](http://www.danbeekim.org/projects/2018/02/28/VIRS-principles/)", 2nd edition, Dec 2245.*
