Asoka - Nice, yes!! Haha I love how gender ambiguous you've drawn them, and I really dig your interpretation of the Biononymous outfit so far! Can you also show them in full outfit?

Iri - SO CUUUUTEEE!!!! love it :D Just one thought, it would be great to make Iri look like a "cuttlefish-inspired mechapet" and not just "a cuttlefish" :)
