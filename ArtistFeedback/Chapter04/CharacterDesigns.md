Asoka and Iri - Oooooooo I love them so much!! Iri is supercute, and definitely looks like a "cuttlefish-inspired mechapet" and not just "a cuttlefish" :D

DAAAAAW PURRING IRI!!

Ashoka_Iri_v2_1.jpg - (lol by the way it's actually "Asoka" :P) I really like the accordion folding technique for the hood! As long as the bottom edge of the face veil has a way to be secured, I really like this design!

Ashoka_Iri_v2_3.jpg - oooo, is this the cuttlefish cloth outfit?

Eireena_Outfit.jpg - oooooo I LOVE this robe and head scarf design!! Haha, I'm tickled by the face veil design here, like window shades...lol would it be too silly to have tiny ropes on one side to lower and roll up the face veil?

Serena_Outfit.jpg - YESS!! Nice nod to medieval helmets in the headscarf shape!! Love how the symbols are laid out on the outfit!!
