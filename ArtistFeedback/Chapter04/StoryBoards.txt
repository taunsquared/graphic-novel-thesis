Page 1 - Looks great! Can't wait to see this in color :D There were some adjustments to the script, heads up!

Page 2 - YAAAAAAASSSSS!!! this is perfect. can Iri look more like it's clinging to the wall instead of floating through the hallways?

Page 3 - ??

Page 4 - I've tweaked the script based on your suggestions here, and the new arc of chapter 4. Also, I LOVE how you've drawn the Biononymous head scarves haha!

Page 5 - Love how you are drawing Iri and Asoka, such good facial expressions!

Page 6 - The script has changed a bit here, less dialogue and more imagery, but I LOVE how you've drawn Iri on top of Asoka's head :D

Page 7 - This page is perfect :D

Page 8 - Also love this page! Haha Asoka's face when Serena says the outfit is powered by waste products!! <3

Page 9 - Oooooh my goooooood I love Asoka and Iri's matching faces in the upper right, SOOO CUUTE!!! Oh the bottom half of this page will be a bit different, please see changes in the script!

Page 10 - Again, the faces are all so spot on! I'm wondering though, it would be kinda cool if the flashback could cut across the page a bit more, to visualize how abrupt and overwhelming it is? I also love it as is :D
