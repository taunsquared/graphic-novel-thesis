Page 1 - Looks great! Can't wait to see this in color :D There were some adjustments to the script, heads up!

Page 2 - YAAAAAAASSSSS!!! this is perfect. can Iri look more like it's clinging to the wall instead of floating through the hallways?

Page 3 - Haha, yess!! Lol, just because everything else in the graphic novel is in celsius, can the temperature reading change units? And Asoka's face in the final panel is PERFECT -- also this relates to your question about how to portray faces when Biononymous are wearing their face veils -- imagine that the face veil has a cartoon-y schematic of a face embroidered onto it with eSyrup thread, and the eSyrup embroidery can "morph" the cartoon schematic-y face into different expressions...so actually, in this scene, when Asoka is eating, the face veil should be off, but later, when Asoka is wandering the bilge after eating, the face veil should be on and the facial expressions should be drawn more or less the way you've drawn it here in the last panel. 

Page 4 - I've tweaked the script based on your suggestions here, and the new arc of chapter 4. Also, I LOVE how you've drawn the Biononymous head scarves haha!

Page 5 - Love how you are drawing Iri and Asoka, such good facial expressions!

Page 6 - The script has changed a bit here, less dialogue and more imagery, but I LOVE how you've drawn Iri on top of Asoka's head :D

Page 7 - This page is perfect :D

Page 8 - Also love this page! Haha Asoka's face when Serena says the outfit is powered by waste products!! <3

Page 9 - Oooooh my goooooood I love Asoka and Iri's matching faces in the upper right, SOOO CUUTE!!! Oh the bottom half of this page will be a bit different, please see changes in the script!

Page 10 - Again, the faces are all so spot on! I'm wondering though, it would be kinda cool if the flashback could cut across the page a bit more, to visualize how abrupt and overwhelming it is? I also love it as is :D

Page 11 - Haha, maybe it's just because things aren't colored yet, but the Navigation Officer looks a bit like they are wearing a nurse's outfit XD I love the monkey-ish posture in the bottom left panel! For the map, take a look at [this](https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=1Y8iEuFi3Qe5qZuOaLN8kwWPE7Rs1kN8E) - the Amazon River is actually a bit more horizontal as one travels up river, and South America is shifted a bit more west of North America. 

Page 12 - Daaaaw, da Beasties!! Haha, so actually, can this last panel give off a scarier vibe? Maybe if the camera angle was changed a bit, so that the Beasts look HUGE and take up most of the panel, and we see a tiny, terrified Asoka in the background? I just want something to convey the feeling of shock and terror a bit more...even while simultaneously showing how cute and vulnerable any creature can be when sleeping :D
