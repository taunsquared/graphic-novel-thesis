Page 1 - Looks great! Can't wait to see this in color :D There were some adjustments to the script, heads up!

Page 2 - Yes, exactly! Iri should definitely both cling to walls and hold onto pipes...I actually like seeing multiple Iri's in one panel, is a nice way to show Iri's movement towards the command deck :D

Page 3 - Perfect!

Page 4 - Nice, yes!

Page 5 - Love how you are drawing Iri and Asoka, such good facial expressions!

Page 6 - NIIIICE! Even though it doesn't make sense spatially, I would like to see Serena's face, so maybe could we see her in the bottom left corner?

Page 7 - This page is perfect :D

Page 8 - Also love this page! Haha Asoka's face when Serena says the outfit is powered by waste products!! <3

Page 9 - Oooooh my goooooood I love Asoka and Iri's matching faces in the upper right, SOOO CUUTE!!! Oh the bottom half of this page will be a bit different, please see changes in the script!

Page 10 - NICE, YES! One last tweak, if in some corner we see Pippa's happy face as they run down towards the village, Manut flying behind them, that would be lovely...I'm trying to make it more obvious that Asoka feels really really guilty about basically sending Pippa to their death, and how that is affecting Asoka's emotional journey throughout the story. 

Page 11 - Yes, the map is now perfect! And I really love how your chapter is like a sci-fi future version of medieval europe!!

Page 12 - Yes, good point, Asoka has their face veil on, so the shock on their face should be a schematic. For the last panel, maybe give less space to the pipes and bilge water and just let the Beasts take up like 75% of the panel?
