# Feedback on Character Designs

General feedback - can you do a full page for each character, showing them in various states of dress (for the Biononymous, show the full range of full outfit to just trousers and sleeveless shirt) or in various color/shape configurations for Iri?

Asoka - YAAAASSSSS I love it!!! Daw, the scraggly hair is so endearing!!

Iri - cuuuuute! can you also show Iri when its camouflaged, or flattened? Also, it would be great to make Iri look like a "cuttlefish-inspired mechapet" and not just "a cuttlefish" :)

Serena - WOOOOOOW!!! Omg she looks so badass!!!! And I'm so in love with the colours!!!

Eireena - ooooo nice!! can the royalactin motif be a bit more prominent?
