Page 1 - Yes, I love the new home structures!! In the final version, can the Beasts be even bigger, relative to the home structures? It looks like there's a tiny moon in the top left panel, but the attack happens in the  middle of the day :) Also, something about seeing Asoka's legs in the 4th "jagged panel" feels odd...I kind of only want to see Asoka in those bottom 2 panels. Maybe if that last panel conveyed more of a sense of frantic movement? Oh, what if instead of Asoka's legs with the Haven in the background, we see in the background the forest and hills between Green Haven Howes and Green Haven Clarksville? Also, in the bottom left panel, can we see Asoka literally face down in the dirt, with a puff of dust to suggest that they hit the ground with some force? And I think I would prefer to put the thought dialogue ("Dad...Pippa...Why??" also, I made some dialogue tweaks... XD) in that left bottom panel, so that the right one (which is perfect!) has just "Must...reach...the next...Haven!"

Page 2 - Oooh, I like the grove of trees instead of a human-made structure! lol Io's face in the last panel is gold!

Page 3 - Yes, love the terraced hillside! But I did really like the old angle, where you see the hill on profile and the children pushing barrels up the incline...again, I think you could give more space to that opening image, in order to fit a view of the terraced hill and also see the children going up a steep incline towards it. In the third row, I think for the purposes of story, you can jump straight to the last panel where Pippa complains "There are always so hard to do with gloves" (I love Pippa's face here btw!) Oh, and I really liked the old version of the last bottom panel, where we see a close-up of Asoka's wink to Pippa and more scenery in the background, can that come back? 

Page 4 - YES THIS PAGE IS PERFECT!!

Page 5 - YES! Aww, Pippa's face in row 2 left panel...such pout!

Page 6 - I LOVE THIS PAGE!! My only comment is, if we are up here because these plants need more sunlight, then it would be great for the greenhouse to reflect that need, and have it be some kind of open-roof or transparent roof structure. Remember that Asoka and the Biononymous children are already wearing the protective clothing they need, so these buildings should optimise for the needs of the plants!

Page 7 - Again, my only feedback here is to somehow convey a greater sense of incline and distance for that last image on the bottom of the page...maybe it would help to have a treeline between Asoka and the Haven?

Page 8 - This is looking great! Is the panel with "It's quite strange actually..." supposed to be a close-up of the shrine?

Page 9 - YES, that last panel is exactly what I was looking for! Just a small tweak, if we could see Eireena's face in profile, just to see her facial expression - one of concern, sadness, and grim determination, with her eyes a bit "cheated" (theater term...) so that even though she is profile in the image, it looks like she is looking at Asoka and the reader still gets to see Eireena's face?

Page 10 - wow this page is perfect!! my only request is that in the final version, the walls be covered in embroidered tapestries...but the composition is almost exactly as I imagined it! And Asoka's facial expressions are perfect...I would say that their face in the panel where Fili says "it's ok to feel pain" maybe Asoka should look more guilty...during this scene Asoka should be thinking about how they sent Pippa to their death. Oh, also Fili shouldn't have a head scarf, so we should see his hair (which I'm imagining to be dreds) 

Page 11 - I'm a bit confused by the top right panel - is that Serena in the middle? If so, I would expect her to be facing Asoka, to match the next panel. In the panel where Eireena says "Asoka", can we get a view of Asoka instead, especially since the immediately previous and next panel face Eireena? That way you can also show Asoka eating the raspberries :) Love the rest of the panels!!

Page 12 - Nice! Haha, can Serena look waaaay more pissed? And the final eyes at the bottom, are they Eireena or Asoka? Because I really love the idea of them being Asoka :)
