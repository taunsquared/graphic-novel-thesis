Feedback on Character Designs

Asoka - don't forget their face veil! And can you incorporate the Biononymous motifs as described in the Character Profiles?

Iri - cuuuuute! can you also show Iri when its camouflaged, or flattened?

Serena - looks good so far! Can you also show Serena in her capacity as bodyguard to the High Priestess?

Eireena - ??
