Feedback on Character Designs

General feedback - can you do a full page for each character, showing them in various states of dress (for the Biononymous, show the full range of full outfit to just trousers and sleeveless shirt) or in various color/shape configurations for Iri?

Asoka - don't forget their face veil! And can you incorporate the Biononymous motifs as described in the Character Profiles?

Iri - cuuuuute! can you also show Iri when its camouflaged, or flattened?

Serena - looks good so far! Can you also show Serena in her capacity as bodyguard to the High Priestess?

Eireena - ooooo nice!! can the royalactin motif be a bit more prominent?
