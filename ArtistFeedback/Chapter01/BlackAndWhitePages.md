# Feedback on Black and White pages, Chapter 01

Page 3 - Love it!

Page 4 - Haha, yes Marcia looks great! And I love the details on Majhee's desk info-sphere :D

Page 5 - Yes, Majhee's desk is way better! I love the total lack of keyboard, mouse, or flat screen - perfect!

Page 6 - Haha, I like Vec in the 2nd row panel better than the top row...and I think the only difference is that in the 2nd row his dreds are coloured in? Lol. I think in the top panel Vec looks a little too pudgy, whereas in the 2nd row he looks about right, like someone who is large but could be muscled, if he weren't always working at a lab bench. I was imagining Breno even thinner and taller, a bit stickly, and Beatriz a little more fashionable (stereotypical Italian chic). Can't see much of Iara but she looks appropriately atheltic. Nova I was imagining a little bit shorter than how you currently portray her; I was imagining her being no taller than Vec's shoulder. Felix looks perfect :)

Page 9 - Ah, love the new angle on the bottom panel!

Page 10 - Yes, love Iuna's desk and the older gentleman's head mod!

Page 11 - Yes, these images are perfect!!

Page 12 - YES! Totally nailed it on this page!! Love the angles, the layout, and that last bottom panel is GORGEOUS!!!
