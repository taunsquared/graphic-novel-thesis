# Feedback on Character Designs

Asoka - I love it!! I would just update the cuttlefish cloth outfit with the visual motifs from Asoka's home haven, see the Character Profiles doc please!

Iri - cuuuuute ^.^ Just one thought, it would be great to make Iri look like a "cuttlefish-inspired mechapet" and not just "a cuttlefish" :)

Min - Aaah, so good! One note, I've updated Min's back tatoo to be a star field instead of a shallow coral reef scene, please see Character Profiles doc!
