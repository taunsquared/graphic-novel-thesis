# Feedback on Character Designs

Asoka - YES!! love how you integrated the Haven-specific symbols!!

Iri - cuuuuute ^.^ Just one thought, it would be great to make Iri look like a "cuttlefish-inspired mechapet" and not just "a cuttlefish" :)

Min - Lovely!! Can the line art tattoos on Min's legs be visible through the slits in her trousers? Also, I've updated the info about the star field tattoo in the character profile - I want it to show the major constellations and brightest objects in the sky so that an astronomer could potentially recognize the star field :) Also, can the edges of the night-sky background fade into whisps that curl around Min's shoulders and torso to be just barely visible from the front?
