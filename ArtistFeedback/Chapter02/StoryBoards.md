Page 1 - love the top panel, not sure what's happening in the middle panels? The bottom looks great as well, but where is the silica mining rig?

Page 2 - LOVE THIS PAGE! I may adjust the dialogue, since we are seeing the pH level displayed on the infosphere. Haha, love Dr. Molina! Also, for the infosphere, can there be some visualization of currents, kind of like this: https://earth.nullschool.net/#current/ocean/surface/currents/orthographic=-70.33,15.94,557/loc=-80.845,23.848 ?

Page 3 - This page is also great!! For the large info-spheres, they can just look like an enormous 3-D video...especially in this scene, we don't have to see the "edges" of the infosphere :)

Page 4 - In the top panel, can we Dr. Fischmann be facing towards the reader so that we get a glimpse of her face? I'll also try to trim the dialogue a bit!

Page 5 - Haha, nice, I like all of your notes about how to convey chaos! What did you and Matteo decide about the institute's outer look?

Page 6 - Can the top panel, showing the chaos in the lab, focus on Vec, Nova, Beatriz, and Kai, and show Demetrio, Amana, Nicola, and Nerio in the background? Also, the transgenic rat should be in some kind of incubator like device, with comfortable bedding underneath and hooked up to breathing support machines instead of in a bottle :)

Page 7 - I love the composition of this page! Yes, to close-up on the rat, and then a big panel showing the chaos outside!

Page 8 - love the composition here as well! I want us to take a breather from the chaos outside and have some moments of familiar social rituals, like greeting each other with kisses and hugs. Great close-up of Amana! I want to see pimply teenager trying really hard to hide how scared he is :Demetrio

Page 9 - aaah, love the camera angles on this page! Is the child in the bottom left panel Nicola, or Nerio? I want Nicola to be clearly too young to understand the dangers of the situation, which is why she is all cute and giggly, while Nerio is just old enough to understand, but also young enough to trust the adults around him completely and believe that no matter what he will be safe in their care (as opposed to Amana, who is old enough to realise that even adults are humans and can make mistakes). 

Page 10 - I will take a look at the text for this page again, to see if I can shorten it maybe. For the Mato Grosso panel, we see a slightly more dramatic scene, where Majhee and the lab has just climbed a small hill or something, to get a dramatic view of the surrounding area? And it would be nice to see them from the front. Similar thoughts on the bottom panel, can we get a close-up of Iuna in the queue, and we see around her people vomiting and showing other signs of toxic gas poisoning?
